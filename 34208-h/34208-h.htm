<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>The officer whose collar ornaments were the
winged staff and serpents of the medical
branch, held what was left of the deck in his
right hand and moistened the tip of his thumb against
the tip of his tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reënforcements, major?&#8221; he inquired with a
glance to the man at his left, and the poker face of
the gentleman so addressed remained impervious to
expression as the answer was given back:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll stand by what I&#8217;ve got here.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the utterance hung on a quarter second of indecision
it was a circumstance that went unnoted, save
possibly by a young man with the single bars of a
lieutenant on his shoulder straps&mdash;and Spurrier gave
no flicker of recognition of what had escaped the
others.</p>
<p>Between the whitewashed walls of the room where
the little group of officers sat at cards the Philippine
night breeze stirred faintly with a fevered breath that
scarcely disturbed the jalousies.</p>
<p>The pile of poker chips had grown to a bulkiness
and value out of just proportion to the means of army
officers below field rank&mdash;and except for the battalion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
commander and the surgeon none there held higher
grade than a captaincy. This jungle-hot weather
made men irresponsible.</p>
<p>One or two of the faces were excitedly flushed; several
others were morosely dark. The lights guttered
with a jaundiced yellow and sweat beaded the temples
of the players. Sweat, too, made slippery the enameled
surfaces of the pasteboards. Sweat seemed to ooze
and simmer in their brains like the oil from overheated
asphalt.</p>
<p>These men had been forced into a companionship
of monotony in a climate of unhealth until their
studied politeness, even their forced jocularity was
rather the effort of toleration than the easy play of
comradeship. Their arduously wooed excitement of
draw-poker, which had run improvidently out of
bounds, was not a pleasure so much as an expedient
against the boredom that had rubbed their tempers
threadbare and put an edgy sharpness on their nerves.</p>
<p>Captain Comyn, upon whose call for cards the
dealer now waited, was thinking of Private Grant out
there under guard in the improvised hospital. The
islands had &#8220;gotten to&#8221; Private Grant and &#8220;locoed&#8221;
him, and he had breathed sulphurous maledictions
against Captain Comyn&#8217;s life&mdash;but it was not those
threats that now disturbed the company commander.</p>
<p>Of late Captain Comyn had been lying awake at
night and wondering if he, too, were not going the
same way as the unfortunate file. Horribly quiet fears
had been stealing poisonously into his mind&mdash;a mind
not given to timidities&mdash;and the word &#8220;melancholia&#8221;
had assumed for him a morbid and irresistible compulsion.
No one save the captain&#8217;s self knew of these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
secret hauntings, born of climate and smoldering fever,
and he would not have revealed them on the torture
rack. For them he entertained the same shame as that
of a boy grown too large for such weakness, who
shudders with an unconfessed fear of the dark. But
he could no more shake them loose and be free of them
than could the Ancient Mariner rid himself of the bird
of ill-omen tied about his neck. Now he pulled himself
together and tossed away a single card.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take one in the place of that,&#8221; he commented
with studied carelessness, and Lieutenant John
Spurrier, with that infectious smile which came readily
to his lips, pointed a contrast with the captain&#8217;s abstraction
by the snappy quickness of his announcement:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m going to trail along, I&#8217;ll need three. Yes,
three, please, major.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Spurrier sits in the game,&#8221; commented a
player who, with a dolorous glance at the booty before
him, threw down his hands, &#8220;we at least get action.
Myself, I&#8217;m out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The battalion commander studied the ceiling with a
troubled furrow between his brows which was not
brought there by the hazards of luck. He was reflecting
that whenever a game was organized it was Spurrier
who quickened its tempo from innocuous amusement
to reckless extravagance. Spurrier, fitted for
his life with so many soldierly qualities, was still,
above all else, a plunger. That spirit seemed a passion
that filled and overflowed him. Temperate in other
habits, he played like a nabob. The major remembered
hearing that even at West Point Jack Spurrier
had narrowly, escaped dismissal for gambling in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
quarters, though his class standing had been distinguished
and his gridiron record had become a tradition.</p>
<p>This sort of game with &#8220;the roof off and deuces
wild,&#8221; was not good for the <i>morale</i> of his junior
officers, mused the major. It was like spiking whisky
with absinthe. Yes, to-morrow he would have Spurrier
at his quarters and talk to him like a Dutch uncle.</p>
<p>There were three left battling for the often
sweetened pot now, with three more who had dropped
out, looking on, and a tensity enveloped the long-drawn
climax of the evening&#8217;s session.</p>
<p>Captain Comyn&#8217;s cheek bones had reddened and his
irascible frown lines deepened. For the moment his
fears of melancholia had been swallowed up in a fitful
fury against Spurrier and his smiling face.</p>
<p>At last came the decisive moment of the final call
and the show-down, and through the dead silence of
the moment sounded the distant sing-song of a sentry:</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporal of the guard, number one, relief!&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the window sill a tiny green lizard slithered
quietly and hesitated, pressing itself flat against the
whitewash.</p>
<p>Then the major&#8217;s cards came down face upward&mdash;and
showed a queen-high straight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite good enough, major,&#8221; announced Comyn
brusquely as his breath broke from him with a sort of
gasp and he spread out a heart flush.</p>
<p>But Spurrier, who had drawn three cards, echoed
the captain&#8217;s words: &#8220;Not quite good enough.&#8221; He
laid down two aces and two deuces, which under the
cutthroat rule of &#8220;deuces wild&#8221; he was privileged to
call four aces.</p>
<p>Comyn came to his feet and pushed back his chair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
but he stood unsteadily. The fever in his bones was
playing queer pranks with his brain. He, whose
courtesy had always been marked in its punctilio,
blazed volcano-fashion into the eruption that had been
gathering through these abnormal days and nights.</p>
<p>Yet even now the long habit of decorum held waveringly
for a little before its breaking, and he began
with a queer strain in his voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to take my <b>IOU</b>. I&#8217;ve lost more than
I can pay on the peg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Comyn,&#8221; began the victor, &#8220;Pay
when&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but before he could finish the other interrupted
with a frenzy of anger:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, by God, it&#8217;s not all right! It&#8217;s all wrong, and
this is the last game I sit in where they deal a hand
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier&#8217;s smiling lips tightened instantly out of
their infectious amiability into a forbidding straightness.
He pushed aside the chips he had been stacking
and rose stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a statement, Captain Comyn,&#8221; he said with
a warning note in his level voice, &#8220;which requires some
explaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>The abrupt bursting of the tempest had left the
others in a tableau of amazement, but now the authoritative
voice of Major Withers broke in upon the
dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, this is an army post, and I am in
command here. I will tolerate no quarrels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without shifting the gaze of eyes that held those
of the captain, Spurrier answered insistently:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have every respect, major, for the requirements
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
of discipline&mdash;but Captain Comyn must finish telling
why he will no longer play cards with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll tell you <i>pronto</i>,&#8221; came the truculent response.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t play with you because you are too
damned lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Spurrier&#8217;s tensity of expression relaxed into
something like amusement for the anticlimax. &#8220;That
accusation can be stomached, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too damned lucky,&#8221; went on the other with a
gathering momentum of rancor, &#8220;and too continuously
lucky for a game that&#8217;s not professional. When a
man is so proficient&mdash;or lucky if you prefer&mdash;that the
card table pays him more than the government thinks
he&#8217;s worth, it&#8217;s time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for you to stop,&#8221; he cautioned sharply.
&#8220;I give you the fairest warning!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Comyn, riding the flood tide of his passion&mdash;a
passion of distempered nerves&mdash;was beyond the
reach of warnings and his words came in a bitter
outpouring:</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say it was only luck that let you bankrupt
young Tillsdale, but it was as fatal to him as if it
bore an uglier name.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound in Spurrier&#8217;s throat was incoherent and
his bodily impulse swift beyond interference. His flat
palm smote Captain Comyn&#8217;s cheek, to come away
leaving a red welt behind it, and as the others swept
forward to intervene the two men grappled.</p>
<p>They were torn apart, still struggling, as Major
Withers, unaccustomed to the brooking of such mutinies,
interposed between them the bulk of his body
and the moral force of his indignantly blazing eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I will have no more of this,&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;I
am not a prize-fight referee, that I must break my
officers out of clinches! Go to your quarters, Comyn!
You, too, Spurrier. You are under arrest. I shall
prefer charges against you both. I mean to make an
example of this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>But with a strange abruptness the fury died out of
Comyn&#8217;s face. It left his passion-distorted features
so instantly that the effect of transformation was uncanny.
In a breathing space he seemed older and his
eyes held the dark dejection of utter misery. His
anger had flared and died before that grimmer emotion
which secretly haunted him&mdash;the fear that he was
going the way of climate-crazed Private Grant.</p>
<p>When they released him he turned dispiritedly and
left the room in docile silence. He was not thinking
of the charges to be preferred. They belonged to to-morrow.
To-night was nearer, and to-night he must
face those hours of sleeplessness that he dreaded more
than all the penalties enunciated by the Articles of
War.</p>
<p>Spurrier, too, bowed stiffly and left the room.</p>
<p>Though it was late when Captain Comyn entered
his own quarters, he did not at once throw himself
on the army cot that stood against the whitewashed
wall.</p>
<p>For him the cot held no invitation&mdash;only the threat
of insomnia and tossing. His taut nerves had lost
the gracious art of relaxation, and before his thoughts
paraded hideously grotesque memories of the few
faces he had ever seen marred by the dethronement of
reason.</p>
<p>Already he had forgotten the violent and discreditable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
scene with Spurrier, and presently he
dropped himself inertly into the camp chair beside the
table at the room&#8217;s center and opened its drawer.</p>
<p>Slowly his hand came out clutching a service revolver,
and his eyes smoldered unnaturally as they
dwelt on it. But after a little he resolutely shook his
head and thrust the thing aside.</p>
<p>He sat in a cold sweat, surrounded by the silence of
the Eastern night, a comprehensive silence which
weighed upon him and oppressed him.</p>
<p>In the thatching of the single-storied adobe building
he heard the rustling of a house snake, and from
without, where moonlight seemed to gush and spill
against the cobalt shadows, shrilled the small voice
from a lizard&#8217;s inflated, crimson throat.</p>
<p>It was all crazing him, and his nails bit into his
palms as he sat there, silent and heavy-breathed.
Then he heard footsteps nearer and louder than those
of the pacing sentries, followed by a low rapping of
knuckles on his own door. Perhaps it was Doctor
James. He had the kindly habit of besetting men who
looked fagged with the offer of some innocuous
bromide. As if bromides could soothe a brain in
which something had gone <i>malo</i>!</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he growled, and into the room stepped
not Major James, but Lieutenant Spurrier.</p>
<p>Slowly and with an infinite weight of weariness,
Comyn rose to his feet. He might be afraid of lunacy,
but not of lieutenants, and his lips smiled sneeringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve come to ask a retraction,&#8221; he declared
ungraciously, &#8220;I&#8217;ve none to offer. I meant all I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>The visitor stood inside the door calmly eyeing the
man who was his own company commander.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come to insist on apologies,&#8221; he replied
after a moment&#8217;s silence with an off-hand easiness of
tone. &#8220;That can wait till you&#8217;ve gotten over your
tantrum. It was another thing that brought me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be left alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aside from the uncomplimentary features of your
tirade,&#8221; went on Spurrier placidly and he strolled around
the table and seated himself on the window sill, &#8220;there
was a germ of truth in what you said. We&#8217;ve been
playing too steep a game.&#8221; He paused and the other
man who remained standing by his table, as though he
did not wish to encourage his visitor by seating himself,
responded only with a short, ironic laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Comyn,&#8221; Spurrier&#8217;s voice labored now
with evident embarrassment. &#8220;What I&#8217;m getting at
is this: I don&#8217;t want your <b>IOU</b> for that game. I
simply want you to forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the captain took an angry step forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;m a charity patient?&#8221; he demanded,
as his temper again mounted to storm pressure.
&#8220;Why, damn your impertinence, I don&#8217;t want to talk
to you. I don&#8217;t want you in my quarters!&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier slipped from his seat and an angry flush
spread to his cheek bones.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the hell of a&mdash;gentleman!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The two stood for a few moments without words,
facing each other, while the lieutenant could hear the
captain&#8217;s breath rising and falling in a panting
thickness.</p>
<p>Surgeon James returning from a visit to a colic
sufferer was trudging sleepily along the empty <i>calle</i>
when he noted the light still burning in the captain&#8217;s
window, and with an exclamation of remembrance for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
the officer&#8217;s dark-ringed and sleepless eyes, he wheeled
toward the door. Just as he neared it, a staccato and
heated interchange of voices was borne out to him,
and he hurried his step, but at the same instant a pistol
shot bellowed blatantly in the quiet air and into his
nostrils stole the acrid savor of burned powder.</p>
<p>The door, thrown open, gave him the startling picture
of Comyn sagged across his own table and lying
grotesque in the yellow light; and of Spurrier standing,
wide-eyed by the window, with the green and
cobalt background of the tropic night beyond his
shoulders. While he gazed the lieutenant wheeled
and thrust his head through the raised sash, under
the jalousy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; cried James excitedly, leaping forward to
possess himself of the pistol which Comyn had taken
from his drawer and thrust aside. &#8220;Halt, Spurrier,
or I&#8217;ll have to fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other turned back and faced his captor with
an expression which it was hard to read. Then he
shook his shoulders as though to disentangle himself
from an evil dream and in a cool voice demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to intimate, James, that you suspect
me of killing Comyn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to deny it?&#8221; countered the other
incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great God! I oughtn&#8217;t to have to. That shot was
fired through the window. The bullet whined past
my ear while my back was turned. That was why I
looked out just now. Moreover, I am, as you see,
unarmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God grant that you can prove these things, Spurrier,
but they will need proof.&#8221; The doctor turned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
bend over the prostrate figure, and as he did so voices
rose from the <i>calle</i> where already had sounded the
alarm and response of running feet. &#8220;Or, perhaps,&#8221;
added the doctor with stubborn suggestiveness, &#8220;you
acted in self-defense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the door opened and the corporal of the
guard entered and saluted. His eyes traveled rapidly
about the room and he addressed Spurrier, since James
was not a line officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I picked this revolver up, sir, just outside the
window,&#8221; he said, holding out a service pistol. &#8220;It
was lying in the moonlight and one chamber is empty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier took the weapon, but when the man had
gone James suggested in an even voice: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
think you had better hand that gun to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To you? Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this looks like a case for G. C. M. It
will have a better aspect if I can testify that, after the
gun was brought in, it wasn&#8217;t handled by you except
while I saw you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me&#8221;&mdash;a belligerent flash darted in the
lieutenant&#8217;s eyes&mdash;&#8220;that you are singularly set on hanging
this affair around my neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were with him and no one else was. If I
were you, I&#8217;d go direct to the major and make a statement
of facts. He&#8217;ll be getting reports from other
sources by now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right. Is <i>he</i> dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>The surgeon nodded, and Spurrier turned and closed
the door softly behind him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>The situation of John Spurrier, who was Jack
Spurrier to every man in that command, standing
under the monstrous presumption of having
murdered a brother officer, called for a reaccommodation
of the battalion&#8217;s whole habit of thought. It demanded
a new and unwelcome word in their vocabulary
of ideas, and against it argued, with the hot advocacy
of tested acquaintance, every characteristic of
the man himself, and every law of probability. For
its acceptance spoke only one forceful plea&mdash;evidence
which unpleasantly skirted the actuality of demonstration.
Short of seeing Spurrier shoot his captain down
and toss his pistol through the open window, Major
James could hardly have witnessed a more damaging
picture than the hurriedly opened door had framed to
his vision.</p>
<p>Within the close-drawn cordon of a post, held to
military accountability, facts were as traceable as entries
on a card index&mdash;and these facts began building to
the lieutenant&#8217;s undoing. They seemed to bring out
like acid on sympathetic ink the miracle of a Mr.
Hyde where his comrades had known only a Doctor
Jekyll.</p>
<p>The one man out of the two skeleton companies of
infantry stationed in the interior town who remained
seemingly impervious to the strangulating force of the
tightening net was Spurrier himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>In another man that insulated and steady-eyed confidence
might have served as a manifest of innocence
and a proclamation of clean conscience. But Spurrier
wore a nick-name, until now lightly considered, to
which new conditions had added importance.</p>
<p>They had called him &#8220;The Plunger,&#8221; and now they
could not forget the nickeled and chrome-hardened
gambling nerve which had won for him the sobriquet.
There had been the <i>coup</i> at Oakland, for example,
when a stretch finish had stood to ruin him or suddenly
enrich him&mdash;an incident that had gone down in
racing history and made café talk.</p>
<p>Through a smother of concealing dust and a thunder
of hoofs, the field had struggled into the stretch that
afternoon, tight-bunched, with its snapping silks too
closely tangled for easy distinguishing&mdash;but the cerise
cap that proclaimed Spurrier&#8217;s choice was nowhere in
sight. The bookmakers pedestalled on their high
stools with field glasses glued to their eyes had been
more excited than the young officer on the club-house
lawn, who put away his binoculars while the horses
were still in the back stretch and turned to chat with
a girl.</p>
<p>Three lengths from the finish a pair of distended
nostrils had thrust themselves ahead of the other
muzzles to catch the judges&#8217; eyes, and bending over
steaming withers had nodded a cerise cap.</p>
<p>But the lieutenant who had escaped financial disaster
and won a miniature fortune had gone on talking
to the girl.</p>
<p>Might it not be suspected in these circumstances
that &#8220;Plunger&#8221; Spurrier&#8217;s refusal to treat his accusation
seriously was only an attitude? He was sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
in a game now with his neck at stake and the cards
running against him. Perhaps he was only bluffing
as he had never bluffed before. Possibly he was brazening
it out.</p>
<p>It was not until the battalion had hiked back through
bosque and over mountains to Manila that the lieutenant
faced his tribunal: a court whose simplified
methods cut away the maze of technicalities at which
a man may grasp before a civilian jury of his peers.</p>
<p>If, when he actually sat in the room where the evidence
was heard, his assurance that he was to emerge
clean-shriven began to reel under blows more powerful
than he had expected, at least his face continued to
testify for him with an outward serenity of confidence.</p>
<p>Doctor James told his story with an admirable restraint
and an absolute absence of coloring. He had
meant to go to Comyn, because he read in his eyes the
signs of nerve waste and insomnia; the same things
that had caused too many suicides among the men
whose nervous constitutions failed to adapt themselves
to the climate.</p>
<p>Before he had carried his purpose to fulfillment&mdash;perhaps
a half hour before&mdash;he had gone to look in
on the case of Private Grant, who was suffering from
just such a malady, though in a more serious degree.
That private, a mountaineer from the Cumberland
hills of Kentucky, had been to all appearances merely
a lunatic, although it was a case which would yield to
treatment or perhaps come to recovery even if left
to itself. On this night he had gone to see if Grant
needed an opiate, but had found the patient apparently
sleeping without restlessness, and had not roused him.
At the door of the place where Grant was under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
guard, he had paused for a word with Private Severance
who stood there on sentry duty.</p>
<p>It had been a sticky night following a hot day, and
in the <i>calle</i> upon which lay the command in billets
of nipa-thatched houses, no one but himself and the
sentries were astir during the twenty minutes he had
spent strolling in the moonlight. On rounding a corner
he had seen a light in Comyn&#8217;s window, and he
had gone around the angle of the adobe house, since
the door was on the farther side, to offer the captain
a sleeping potion, too. That was how he chanced on
the scene of the tragedy, just a moment too late for
service.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say,&#8221; began Spurrier&#8217;s counsel, on cross-examination,
&#8220;that you visited Private Grant about
half an hour before Captain Comyn was killed and
found him apparently resting naturally, although on
previous nights you had thought morphia necessary
to quiet his delirium?&#8221;</p>
<p>The major nodded, then qualified slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Grant had not, of course, been continuously out
of his head nor had he always slept brokenly. There
had been lucid periods alternating with exhausting
storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not prepared to swear, though, that this
seeming sleep might not have been feigned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am prepared to testify that it is most unlikely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet that same night he did make his escape and
deserted. That is true, is it not?&#8221;</p>
<p>The major bowed. &#8220;He had sought to escape
before. That was symptomatic of his condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And since then he has not been recaptured, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
he was in your opinion too ill and deranged to have
deceived you by feigning sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever heard Grant threaten Captain
Comyn&#8217;s life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether he had made such threats to your knowledge
or not, he did come from that hill county of the
Kentucky mountains commonly called Bloody Brackton,
did he not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe so. His enlistment record will answer
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do know, though, that the man on guard duty&mdash;the
man with whom you spoke outside&mdash;was Private
Severance, also from the so-called Kentucky feud belt
and a friend of the sick man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can testify of my own knowledge only that he
was Private Severance and that he and Grant were of
the same platoon&mdash;Lieutenant Spurrier&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>The defense advocate paused and carefully framed
a hypothetical question to be answered by the witness
as a medical expert.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will now ask you to speak from your knowledge
of blood tendencies as affected or distorted by mental
abnormalities. Suppose a man to have been born and
raised under a code which still adheres to feudal violence
and the private avenging of personal grievances
both real and fancied. Suppose such a man to have
conceived a bitter hatred against his commanding
officer and to have brooded over that hatred until it
had become a fixed idea&mdash;a monomania&mdash;a determination
to kill; suppose such a man to have known only
the fierce influences of his retarded hills until he came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
into the army and to have encountered there a discipline
which seemed to him a tyranny. I will ask
you whether such a man might not be apt to react
to a homicidal mania under nervous derangement, and
whether such a homicidal mania might not develop
its own craftiness of method?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such,&#8221; testified the medical officer, &#8220;is a conceivable
but a highly imaginative possibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Private Severance was called and came into
the room, where he stood smartly at attention until instructed
to take the witness chair. This dark-haired
private from the Cumberlands looked the soldier from
crown to sole leather, yet his features seemed to hold
under their present repose an ancient stamp of sullenness.
It was an intangible quality rather than an expression,
as though it bore less relation to his present
than to some unconquerable survival from generations
that had passed on; generations that had been always
peering into shadows and searching them for lurking
perils.</p>
<p>In his speech lingered quaintly remnants of dialect
from the laureled hills that army life had failed to
eradicate, and in his manner one could note a wariness
of extreme caution. That was easy to understand,
because Private Severance, too, stood under the charge
of having permitted a prisoner to escape, and his evidence
would confront him later when he in turn occupied
the dock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have no speech with Bud Grant that
night,&#8221; he testified, &#8220;but I&#8217;d looked in some several
times through the window. It was a barred window,
an&#8217; every time I peeked through it I could see Bud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
layin&#8217; there asleep. The moon fell acrost his cot so I
could see him plain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you see him last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After Major James had been in and come out&mdash;a full
fifteen minutes later. I&#8217;m able to swear to
that, because I noticed the moon just as the major
went out, and, when I looked in through the window
the last time, the moon was a full quarter hour lower
down to&#8217;rds settin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s pause the witness volunteered in
amplification: &#8220;Where I come from we don&#8217;t have
many clocks or watches. We goes by the sun and
moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can swear that if Private Grant fired
the shot that killed Captain Comyn, he must have
escaped and eluded your sight; armed himself, crossed
the plaza; turned the corner; accomplished the act and
gotten clean away, all within the brief period of five
minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can swear to more than that. He didn&#8217;t get past
me till <i>after</i> the pistol went off. There wasn&#8217;t no
way out but by the one door, and I was right at that
door all the time until I left it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you leave?&#8221;</p>
<p>The witness gave response without hesitation, yet
with the same serious weighing of his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was standing there, sorter peerin&#8217; up at the stars
an&#8217; beginning to feel right smart tired when I heard
the shot. I heard the shout of the corporal of the
guard, too, an&#8217; then it was that I made my mistake.&#8221;
He paused and went on evenly. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t ought to
have stirred away from my post, but it seemed like a
sort of a general alarm, an&#8217; I went runnin&#8217; to&#8217;rds it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
That was the first chanst Bud had to get away. When
I got back he was gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure he was still there when the shot
sounded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As God looks down, I can swear he was!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the defense took the witness.</p>
<p>&#8220;When does your enlistment expire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two months, come Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know to the day, don&#8217;t you? You are keenly
anxious for that day to come, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t I be? I&#8217;ve got folks at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you and Grant both been malcontents
throughout your entire period of service?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s news to me, if it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you often heard Private Grant swear
vengeance against Captain Comyn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not no more than to belly-ache some little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not a fact that since you and Grant ran amuck
on the transport coming over, and Comyn put you
both in irons, the two of you had sworn vengeance
against him; that you had both taken the blood oath
to get him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Severance looked blankly at his questioner and
blankly shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all new tidings ter me,&#8221; he asserted with
entire calmness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that you deliberately let Grant out
immediately after the visit of Major James and slipped
him the pistol with which he fired the shot? Didn&#8217;t
you do that, knowing that when the report sounded
you could make it your excuse for leaving your post,
and then perjure yourself as to the time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know full well,&#8221; asserted the witness with an unshaken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
composure, &#8220;that nothing like that didn&#8217;t
happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fact built on fact until even the defendant&#8217;s counsel
found himself arguing against a growing and ugly
conviction. The pistol had been identified as Spurrier&#8217;s,
and his explanation that he had left it hanging
in his holster at his quarters, whence some unknown
person might have abstracted it, lacked persuasiveness.
The defense built a structure of hypothesis
based upon the fact that the open door of Spurrier&#8217;s
room was visible from the house where Grant
had been tossing on his cot. The claim was urgently
advanced that a skulking lunatic might easily have
seen the glint of blued steel, and have been spurred in
his madness by the temptation of such an implement
ready to his hand. But that, too, was held to be a
fantastic claim. So the verdict was guilty and the sentence
life imprisonment. It must have been death,
had the case, for all its warp of presumption and woof
of logic, been other than circumstantial.</p>
<p>The defendant felt that this mitigation of the extreme
penalty was a misplaced mercy. The disgrace
could be no blacker and death would at least have
brought to its period the hideousness of the nightmare
which must now stretch endlessly into the future.</p>
<p>It was to a prisoner, sentenced and branded, that
Major Withers came one afternoon when the court-martial
of Lieutenant Spurrier had run its course as
topic-in-chief for the Officers&#8217; Club at Manila. Other
matters were already crowding it out of the minds it
had profoundly shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you, Jack,&#8221; began the major
bluntly. &#8220;I want to talk to you with a candor that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
grows out of the affection we all felt for you&mdash;before
this damnable thing upset our little world. My God,
boy, you had life in your sling. You had every quality
that makes the soldier; you had every social requisite
except wealth. This besetting passion for gambling
has brought the whole train of disaster&mdash;as logically
as if you had killed him at the card table itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are overlooking the fact, major,&#8221; interrupted
the prisoner dryly, &#8220;that I didn&#8217;t kill him. Moreover,
it&#8217;s too late now for the warning to benefit me. I dare
say in Leavenworth I shall have no trouble curbing
my passion for gaming.&#8221; He paused and added with
an irony of despairing bitterness: &#8220;But I suppose I
should thank you and say, like the negro standing on
the gallows, &#8217;dis hyar is surely g&#8217;wine to be a great
lesson ter me.&#8217;&#8221; Suddenly the voice broke and the
young man wheeled to avert his face. &#8220;My God,&#8221; he
cried out, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you let them hang me or shoot
me? Any man can stiffen his legs and his spine for
five minutes of dying&mdash;even public dying&mdash;but back
of those walls with a convict&#8217;s number instead of a
name&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; There he broke off and the battalion
commander laid a hand on his heaving shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come to rub in preachments while you stood
at the edge of the scaffold or the jail, Jack. My warning
may not be too late, after all. We&#8217;ve passed the
matter up to the war department with a strong recommendation
for clemency. We mean to pull every
wire that can honorably be pulled. We&#8217;re making the
most of your good record heretofore and of the conviction
being based on circumstantial evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused a moment and then went on with a
trifle of embarrassment in his voice:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You know that Senator Beverly is at the governor
general&#8217;s palace&mdash;and that his daughter is with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier wheeled at that and stood facing his visitor
with eyes that had kindled, but in which the light at
once faded as he commented shortly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither the senator nor Augusta has made any
effort to see me since I was brought to Manila.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the senator thought that was best, Jack,&#8221;
argued Withers. &#8220;For the daughter, of course, I&#8217;m
not prepared to speak&mdash;but I know that Beverly has
been keeping the cable hot in your behalf. Your name
has become so familiar to the operators between here
and Washington that they don&#8217;t spell it out any more:
they only need to rap out Sp. now&mdash;and if I needed a
voice to speak for me on Pennsylvania Avenue or on
Capitol Hill, there&#8217;s no man I&#8217;d pick before the
senator.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he had gone Spurrier sat alone and to his
ears came the distant playing of a band in the plaza.
Somewhere in that ancient town was the girl who had
not been to see him, nor written to him, even though,
just before his battalion had gone into the bosques
across the mountains, she had let him slip a ring on
her finger, and had answered &#8220;yes&#8221; to his question&mdash;the
most personal question in the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>There was a more assured light in Major
Withers&#8217; eyes when he next came as a visitor
into the prison quarters, and the heartiness of
his hand clasp was in itself a congratulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing was carried up to the president himself,&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;Washington is sick of you, Spurrier.
Because of you miles of red tape have been
snarled up. Departments have worked overtime until
the single hope of the United States government is that
it may never hear of you again. You don&#8217;t go to
prison, after all, my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean I am pardoned?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, remembering that the rose of his bringing
carried a sharp thorn the senior proceeded with a note
of concern sobering his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The red tape has not only been tangled because
of you&mdash;but it has tangled you in its meshes, too,
Spurrier. Yes, you are pardoned. You are as free
as I am&mdash;but &#8216;in view of the gravely convincing evidence,
et cetera, et cetera&#8217;&mdash;it seems that some sort
of compromise was deemed necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier stood where he had risen from his seat
and his eyes held those of his informant with a blending
of inquiry and suspense.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of compromise, major?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave the army with a dishonorable discharge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
The world is open to you and you&#8217;ve got an equipment
for success&mdash;but you might as well recognize
from the start that you&#8217;re riding with a heavy impost
in your saddle clothes, my boy.&#8221; He paused a moment
and then, dropping his race-track metaphor, went hurriedly
on: &#8220;For myself, I think you&#8217;re guilty or innocent
and you ought to be hanged or clean-shriven. I
don&#8217;t get this dubious middle ground of freedom with
a tarnished name. It&#8217;s going to crop up to crab things
for you just when they hang in the balance, and I&#8217;m
damned if I can see its fairness! It will cause men to
look askance and to say &#8216;he was saved from rope-stretching
only by wire-pulling.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The major ended somewhat savagely and Spurrier
made no answer. He was gazing out at the patch of
blue that blazed hotly through the high, barred window
and, seeing there reminders of the bars sinister
that would henceforth stand between himself and the
sky.</p>
<p>The battalion chief interrupted the long pause to
suggest:</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Empress</i> sails on Tuesday. If I were you I&#8217;d
take passage on her. I suppose you will, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends,&#8221; answered the liberated man hesitantly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to thank the senator&mdash;and, though
she hasn&#8217;t sent me any message, there&#8217;s a question to
ask a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s none of my business, of course, Spurrier,&#8221;
came the advising voice quietly. &#8220;But the Beverlys
have engaged passage on the <i>Empress</i>. If I were you,
I&#8217;d drop a formal note of gratitude and leave the rest
until you meet them aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s thought the other nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
follow that suggestion. It may be less embarrassing
for&mdash;them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The other fellows are going to send a sort of a
hamper down to the boat. There won&#8217;t be any cards,
but you&#8217;ll know that a spirit of Godspeed goes with
the stirrup cup.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant Spurrier looked puzzled and the
major, whose note of embarrassment had been growing
until it seemed to choke him, now spluttered and
sought to bury his confusion under a forced paroxysm
of coughing.</p>
<p>Then impulsively he thrust out his hand and
gripped that of the man of whom just now he could
remember only gallant things; soldierly qualities and
gently bred charm.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a fashion, Jack, you must shake hands with all
of them through me. I come as their proxy. They
can&#8217;t give you a blowout, you know. They can&#8217;t even
come to see you off. I can say what I like now. The
papers aren&#8217;t signed up yet, but afterward&mdash;well, you
know! Damn it, I forget the exact words that the
Articles of War employ&mdash;about an officer who goes
out&mdash;this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother, major. I get your meaning.&#8221; Spurrier
took the proffered hand in both his own. &#8220;No
officer can give me social recognition. I believe the
official words are that I shall be &#8216;deemed ignominious.&#8217;
Tell the boys I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the sailing day John Spurrier, whose engagingly
bold eyes had not yet learned to evade the challenge
of any glance, timed his arrival on board almost as
surreptitiously as a stowaway. It was from behind
the closed door of his own stateroom that he listened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
to the deck commotion of laughter and leave-taking
and heard, when the whistle had shrieked its warning
to shore-going visitors, the grind of anchor chain on
winch and windlass.</p>
<p>That evening he dined in an inconspicuous corner
by arrangement with the dining-saloon steward, and
bolted his meal with nervous haste.</p>
<p>From afar, as he had stood in a companionway, he
had glimpsed a panama-hatted girl&mdash;a girl who did
not see him, and who had shown only between the
shifting heads and shoulders of the crowd. He could
not have told even had he been closer whether her
gloved left hand still wore upon its third finger the
ring that he had put there&mdash;before things had
happened.</p>
<p>He must face the issue of questioning her and being
questioned, and he hoped that he might have his first
meeting with her alone&mdash;free from the gaze of other
eyes that would torture him, and perhaps mortify her.</p>
<p>So when the moon had risen and the band had
begun its evening concert he slipped out on deck and
took up his station alone at the stern rail. It was not
entirely dark even here, but the light was mercifully
tempered, and upon the promenaders he turned his
back, remaining in a seclusion from which, with sidewise
glances, he appraised each figure that drifted by.</p>
<p>Once his eyes encountered those of a tall and elderly
gentleman in uniform upon whose shoulder straps
glittered the brigadier&#8217;s single star.</p>
<p>For an instant Spurrier forgot the sadly altered
color of his status and his hand, answering to instinct,
rose in salute, while his lips parted in a smile.</p>
<p>But the older man, who fortunately was alone, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
an embarrassed instant went on, pretending an absent-mindedness
that ignored the salutation. Spurrier
could feel that the general was scarcely more comfortable
than himself.</p>
<p>Slowly, at length, he left his outlook over the phosphorescent
wake and drifted isolatedly about the decks,
giving preference to the spots where the shadows lay
heaviest. But when his wandering brought him again
to the place he had abandoned at the stern, he found
that it had been preëmpted by another. A figure stood
there alone and so quiet that at first he hardly distinguished
it as separate from the black contour of a
capstan.</p>
<p>But with the realization he recognized a panama
hat, from under whose brim escaped a breeze-stirred
strand of dark hair, and promptly he stepped to the
rail, his rubber-soled shoes making no sound.</p>
<p>The girl did not hear him, nor did she, as he found
himself reflecting, feel his presence as lovers do in
romances, and turn to greet him before he announced
himself. But as she stood there in the shadow, with
moonlight and starlight around her, his pulses quickened
with an insupportable commotion of mingled
hope and fear.</p>
<p>Her beauty was that of the aristocrat. It was this
patrician quality which had first challenged his interest
in her and answered to his own inordinate pride of
self-confidence.</p>
<p>He had liked the lightness with which her small feet
trod the earth and the prideful tilt of her exquisitely
modeled chin.</p>
<p>After all, he had known her only a short time&mdash;and
now he realized that he did not know her well:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
certainly not well enough to estimate with any surety
how they would meet again, after an interval which
had tarnished the name that had come to him from
two generations of accrued distinction.</p>
<p>He bent forward, and, in a low voice, spoke her
name, and she turned without a start so that she stood
looking into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you know,&#8221; he began, and for once he
spoke without self-assurance, &#8220;that I didn&#8217;t hunt you
out sooner because I wanted to spare you embarrassment.
I knew you were sailing by this boat&mdash;and so
I took it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, but remained silent. Her
eyes met his and lingered, but they were like curtained
windows and told him nothing. It was as if she
wished to let him pitch the plane of their meeting
without interference, and he was grateful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose,&#8221; he began, forcing himself to
speak with forthright directness, &#8220;I need protest my
innocence to you&mdash;and I don&#8217;t suppose I need confess
that the stigma will stick to me&mdash;that in&mdash;some quarters&mdash;it
will mean ostracism. I wanted to meet you
the first time alone as much for your sake as my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she agreed faintly, but there was no
rush of confidence, of sympathy that thought only of
the black situation in which he stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, too,&#8221; he went on with the same steadiness,
&#8220;that but for your father&#8217;s efforts I should have had
to spend the rest of my life in prison. Above all, I
know that your father made those efforts because you
ordained it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was too horrible,&#8221; she whispered with a little
shudder. &#8220;It was inconceivable.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It still is,&#8221; he reminded her. &#8220;There is a question,
then, to be asked&mdash;a question for you to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s hands dropped on the rail and her fingers
tightened as her eyes, deeply pained, went off across
the wake. She seemed unable to help him, unable to
do more than give back monosyllabic responses to the
things he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I can&#8217;t assume that the promise you
gave me&mdash;before all this&mdash;still stands, unless you can
ratify it. I&#8217;m the same man, yet quite a different
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last she turned, and he saw that her lashes were
wet with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; she suggested almost pleadingly, &#8220;some
day surely you will be able to clear your name&mdash;now
that you&#8217;re free to give yourself to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head, &#8220;That is going to be the purpose
of my life,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But God only
knows&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have done that,&#8221; she impetuously exclaimed,
&#8220;come back to me. I&#8217;ll wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Spurrier shook his head and stiffened a little,
not indignantly, but painfully, and his face grew paler
than it had yet been.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is generous of you,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;That
is the best I had the right to hope for&mdash;but it&#8217;s not
enough. It would be a false position for you&mdash;with a
mortgage of doubt on your future. I&#8217;ve got to face
this thing nakedly. I&#8217;ve got to depend only on those
people who don&#8217;t need proof&mdash;who simply know that
I must be innocent of&mdash;of <i>this</i> because it would be impossible
for me to be guilty of it&mdash;people,&#8221; he added,
his voice rising with just a moment&#8217;s betrayal of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
boyish passion, &#8220;who will take the seeming facts, just
as they are, and still say, &#8216;Damn the facts!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I do that?&#8221; She asked the question honestly,
with eyes in which sincere tears glistened, and at last
words came in freshet volume. &#8220;Can I ignore the
fact that father is in public life, where his affairs and
those of his family are public property? You know
he is talked of as presidential timber. Can I ask him
to move heaven and earth to give you back your
liberty&mdash;and then have his critics say that it was all
for a member of his own family&mdash;a private use of
public power?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you want your promise back?&#8221; he demanded
quietly.</p>
<p>Suddenly the girl carried her hands to her face, a
face all the lovelier for its distress. &#8220;I don&#8217;t&mdash;know
what&mdash;I want,&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>Her lover stood looking down at her, and his
temples grew coldly moist where the veins stood out.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t know what you want, dear, I know
one thing that you can&#8217;t do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Under these
circumstances, your only chance of happiness would
lie in your wanting one thing so much that the rest
wouldn&#8217;t count.&#8221; He paused, and then he, too, moved
aside and stood with her, leaning on the rail while
in the phosphorescent play of the water and the broken
reflections of the low-hung stars he seemed to find a
sort of anodyne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said that what you offered was the most I had
the right to hope for. That was true. Your father&#8217;s
objections are legitimate. I owe you both more than
I can ever pay&mdash;but I won&#8217;t add to that debt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said the girl miserably, &#8220;that I loved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
you&mdash;enough for anything. The shock of all this&mdash;has
made my mind swirl so that now&mdash;I&#8217;m not sure of
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said dully, &#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet perhaps what he understood, or thought he
understood, just then was either more or less than
implied in the deferential compliance of his voice.
This girl had given her promise to an officer and a
gentleman with two generations of gallant army
record behind him and a promising future ahead. She
was talking now to one who, in the words of the Articles
of War was neither an officer nor a gentleman and
who had been saved from life imprisonment only by
influence of her own importuning.</p>
<p>Her own distress of mind and incertitude were so
palpable and pathetic that the man had spoken with
apology in his voice, because through him she had
been forced into her dilemma. Yet, until now, he had
been young enough and naïve enough to believe in
certain tenets of romance&mdash;and, in romance, a woman
who really loved a man would not be weighing at
such a time her father&#8217;s aspirations toward the White
House. In romance, even had he been as guilty as
perdition, he would have stood in her eyes, incapable
of crime. Palpably life and romance followed variant
laws and, for a bitter moment, Spurrier wished that
the senator had kept hands off, and left him to his fate.</p>
<p>He had heard the senator himself characterized as
a man cold-bloodedly ambitious and contemptuous of
others and, having seen only the genial side of that
prominent gentleman, he had resentfully denied such
statements and made mental comment of the calumny
that attaches to celebrity.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>Yet, Spurrier argued to himself, the girl was right.
Quite probably if he had a sister similarly placed, he
would be seeking to show her the need of curbing impulse
with common sense.</p>
<p>From a steamer chair off somewhere at their backs
came a low peal of laughter, and the orchestra was
busy with a fox trot. For perhaps five minutes neither
of them spoke again, but at last the girl twisted the
ring from her finger. At least her loyalty had kept it
there until she could remove it in his presence. She
handed it to him and he turned it this way and that.
The moonlight teased from its setting a jet of cold
radiance.</p>
<p>Then Spurrier tossed it outward and watched the
white arc of its bright vanishing. He heard a muffled
sob and saw the girl turn and start toward the companionway
door. Instinctively he took a step forward
following, then halted and stood where he was.</p>
<p>Later, Spurrier forced himself toward the smoke
room where already under cigar and cigarette smoke,
poker and bridge games were in progress, and where
in little groups those men who were not playing discussed
the topics of East and West. He was following
no urge of personal fancy in entering that place,
but rather obeying a resolution he had made out there
on deck. Now that he had asked his question and
had his answer there was nothing from which he
could afford to hide. He knew that he came heralded
by the advance agency of gossip and that it behooved
him from the start to meet and give back
glance for glance: to declare by his bearing that he
had no intention of skulking, and no apologies to
make.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>Yet, having reached the entrance from the deck,
he hesitated, and while he still stood, with his back to
the lighted door of the smoke room, he reeled under
a sudden impact and was thrown against the rail. Recovering
himself with an exclamation of anger, Spurrier
found himself confronting a man rising from his
knees, whose awkwardness had caused the collision.</p>
<p>But the stumbling person having regained his feet,
stood seemingly shaken by his fall, and after a
moment, during which Spurrier eyed him with hostile
silence, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Plunger Spurrier!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not my name, sir,&#8221; retorted the ex-officer
hotly. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not one that I care to have strangers
employ.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man drew back a step, and the light from the
doorway fell across a face a little beyond middle age;
showing a broad forehead and strongly chiseled features
upon which sat an expression of directness and
force.</p>
<p>&#8220;My apology is, at least, as ready as was my exclamation,&#8221;
declared the stranger in a pleasant voice
that disarmed hostility. &#8220;The term was not meant
offensively. I saw you at Oakland one day when a
race was run, and I&#8217;ve heard certain qualities of yours
yarned about at mess tables in the East. I ask your
pardon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s granted,&#8221; acceded Spurrier of necessity. &#8220;And
since you&#8217;ve heard of me, you doubtless know enough
to make allowances for my short temper and excuse
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>have</i> heard your story,&#8221; admitted the other man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
frankly. &#8220;My name is Snowdon. It&#8217;s just possible
you may have heard of me, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not Snowdon the engineer: the Panama
Canal man, the Chinese railway builder, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a hand in those enterprises,&#8221; was the answer,
and with a slight bow the gentleman went his way.</p>
<p>The spot where the two men had stood talking was
far enough aft to look down on the space one deck
lower and one degree farther astern, where, as through
a well space, showed the meaner life of the steerage.
There was a light third-class list on this voyage, and
when Spurrier moved out of the obscurity which had
been thrown over him by the life boat&#8217;s shadow, he
stood gazing idly down on an empty prospect. He
gazed with an interest too moodily self-centered for
easy inciting.</p>
<p>He himself stood now clear shown under the frosted
globe of an overhead light and, after a little, roused
to a tepid curiosity, he fancied he could make out
what seemed to be a human figure that clung to the
blackest of the shadows below him.</p>
<p>He even fancied that in that lower darkness he
caught the momentary dull glint of metal reflecting
some half light, and an impression of furtive movement
struck in upon him. But after a moment&#8217;s
scrutiny, which failed to clarify the picture, he decided
that his imagination had invented the vague shape out
of nothing more tangible than shadow. If there had
been a man there he seemed to have dissolved now.</p>
<p>So Spurrier turned away.</p>
<p>Had his eyes possessed a nearer kinship to those of
the cat, which can read the dark, he would have altered
his course of action from that instant forward. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
would, first, have gone to the captain and demanded
permission to search the steerage for an ex-private of
the infantry company that had lately been his own; a
private against whose name on the muster roll stood
the entry: &#8220;Dead or deserted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet when he turned on his heel and passed from
the lighted area he unconsciously walked out of range
of a revolver aimed at his breast&mdash;thereby temporarily
settling for the man who fingered the trigger his question,
&#8220;to shoot or not to shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Private Grant, a fleeing deserter, convalescent
from fever and lunacy, had been casting up the
chances of his own life just then and debating the dangers
and advantages of letting Spurrier live. Recognizing
his former officer as he himself looked out of
his hiding, his first impulse had been one of panic
terror and in Spurrier he had seen a pursuer.</p>
<p>The finger had twitched nervously on the trigger&mdash;then
while he wavered in decision the other had
calmly walked out of range. Now, if he kept out of
sight until they reached Frisco, the deserter told himself,
a larger territory would spread itself for his
escape than the confines of a steamer, and he belonged
to a race that can bide its time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>Spurrier entered the smoke room and stood
for a moment in its threshold.</p>
<p>There were uniforms there, and some men in
them whom he had known, though now these other-time
acquaintances avoided his eye and the necessity
of an embarrassment which must have come from
meeting it.</p>
<p>But from an alcove seat near the door rose a
stocky gentleman, well groomed and indubitably distinguished
of guise, who had been tearing the covering
from a bridge deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spurrier, my boy,&#8221; he exclaimed cordially, &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad to see you. I read your name on the list. Won&#8217;t
you join us?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the man who had rolled away the mountains
of official inertia and saved him from prison;
who had stipulated with his daughter that she should
not write to him in his cell; and who now embraced
the first opportunity to greet him publicly with cordial
words. Here, reflected the cashiered soldier, was poise
more calculated than his own, and he smiled as he
shook his head, giving the answer which he knew to
be expected of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, senator.&#8221; Then he added a request:
&#8220;But if these gentlemen can spare you for a
few minutes I would appreciate a word with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, my boy.&#8221; With a glance about the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
company which made his excuses, Beverly rose and
linked his arm through Spurrier&#8217;s, but when they
stood alone on deck that graciousness stiffened immediately
into manner more austere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen Augusta,&#8221; began the younger man briefly,
&#8220;and told her I wouldn&#8217;t seek to hold her to her
promise. I suppose that meets with your approval?&#8221;</p>
<p>The public man, whom rumor credited with presidential
aspirations, nodded. &#8220;Under the circumstances
it is necessary. I may as well be candid. I
tried vainly to persuade her to throw you over entirely,
but I had to end in a compromise. She agreed
not to communicate with you in any manner until
your trial came to its conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cashiered officer felt his temples hammering
with the surge of indignant blood to his forehead.
This man who had so studiedly and successfully
feigned genuine pleasure at seeing him, when other
eyes were looking on, was telling him now with salamander
coolness that he had urged upon his daughter
the policy of callous desertion. The impulse toward
resentful retort was almost overpowering, but with
it came the galling recognition that, except for Beverly&#8217;s
bull-dog pertinacity, Spurrier himself would
have been a life-termer, and that now humility became
him better than anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you seek to have Augusta throw me over,
without even a farewell&mdash;because you believed me
guilty, sir?&#8221; His inquiry came quietly and the older
man shook a noncommittal head.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much what I think as what the world
will think,&#8221; he made even response. &#8220;To put it in
the kindest words, Spurrier, you rest under a cloud.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Senator,&#8221; said the other in measured syllables, &#8220;I
rest, also, under a great weight of obligation to you,
but, there were times, sir, when for a note from her
I&#8217;d willingly have accepted the death penalty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t pretend that I fail to understand&mdash;even
to sympathize with you,&#8221; came the answer. &#8220;You
must see none the less that I had no alternative. Augusta&#8217;s
husband must be&mdash;well, like Cæsar&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing more to be said, I think,&#8221; admitted
Spurrier, and the senator held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;In every other matter, I feel only as your friend.
It will be better if to other eyes our relations remain
cordial. Otherwise my efforts on your behalf would
give the busy-bodies food for gossip. That&#8217;s what we
are both seeking to avoid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier bowed and watched the well-groomed figure
disappear.</p>
<p>The cloudless days and the brilliant nights of low-hung
stars and phosphor waters were times of memorable
opportunity and paradise for other lovers on
that steamer. For Spurrier they were purgatorial
and when he realized Augusta Beverly&#8217;s clearly indicated
wish that he should leave her free from the embarrassment
of any tete-a-tete, he knew definitely that
her silence was as final as words could have made it.
The familiar panama hat seen at intervals and the
curve of the cheek that he had once been privileged to
kiss seemed now to belong to an orbit of life remote
from his own with an utterness of distance no less
actual because intangible.</p>
<p>The young soldier&#8217;s nature, which had been prodigally
generous, began to harden into a new and unlovely
bitterness. Once he passed her as she leaned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
on the rail with a young lieutenant who was going to
the States on his first leave from Island duty, and
when the girl met his eyes and nodded, the cub of an
officer looked up&mdash;and cut him dead with needless
ostentation.</p>
<p>For the old general, who had pretended not to see
him, Jack Spurrier had felt only the sympathy due to
a man bound and embarrassed by a severe code of
etiquette, but with this cocksure young martinet, his
hands itched for chastisement.</p>
<p>Throughout the trying voyage Spurrier felt that
Snowdon, the engineer, was holding him under an interested
sort of observation, and this surveillance he
mildly resented, though the entire politeness of the
other left him helpless to make his feeling outspoken.
But when they had stood off from Honolulu and
brought near to completion the last leg of the Pacific
voyage, Snowdon invited him into his own stateroom
and with candid directness spoke his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spurrier,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to have a straight
talk with you if you will accept my assurance of the
most friendly motive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier was not immediately receptive. He sat
eying the other for a little while with a slight frown
between his eyes, but in the end he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should dislike to seem churlish,&#8221; he answered
slowly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve had my nerves rubbed raw of
late, and they haven&#8217;t yet grown callous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it&#8217;s rather in my line,&#8221; suggested Snowdon
by way of preface, &#8220;to assay the minerals of character
in men and to gauge the percentage of pay-dirt
that lies in the lodes of their natures. So I&#8217;ve watched
you, and if you care to have the results of my superficial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
research, I&#8217;m ready to report. No man knows
himself until introduced to himself by another, because
one can&#8217;t see one&#8217;s self at sufficient distance to
gain perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier smiled. &#8220;So you&#8217;re like the announcer at
a boxing match,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;You&#8217;re ready to
say, &#8216;Plunger Spurrier, shake hands with Jack Spurrier&mdash;both
members of this club.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; assented Snowdon as naturally as
though there had been no element of facetiousness in
the suggestion. &#8220;And now in the first place, what do
you mean to do with yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have thought of the possibilities
open to a West Point man&mdash;as a soldier of fortune?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the answer was unenthusiastic. &#8220;Thought
of them and discarded them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice laughed and then spoke contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s sword belongs to his flag. It can no
more be honorably hired out than a woman&#8217;s love. I
can see in either only a form of prostitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Snowdon heartily. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
have coached you to a better answer. Are you financially
independent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I have nothing. Until now there
was my pay and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He paused there but went on
again with a dogged self-forcing. &#8220;I might as well
confess that the gaming table has always left a balance
on my side of the ledger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you playing since you came aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve cut that out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good again&mdash;and that brings us to where I stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
eliciting information about yourself and begin giving
it. I had heard of your gambling exploits before I
saw you. I found that you had that cold quality of
nerve which a few gamblers have, fewer than are
credited with it, by far! Incidentally, it&#8217;s precisely
the same quality that makes notable generals&mdash;and
adroit diplomats&mdash;if they have the other qualities to
support it. It&#8217;s sublimated self-control and boldness.
You were using it badly, but it was because you were
seeking an outlet through the wrong channels. So I
studied you, quite impersonally. Your situation on
board wasn&#8217;t easy or enviable. You knew that eyes
followed you and tongues wagged about you with a
morbid interest. You saw chatting groups fall abruptly
silent when you approached them and officers
you had once fraternized with look hurriedly elsewhere.
In short, my young friend, you have faced
an acid test of ordeal, and you have borne yourself
with neither the defiance of braggadocio, nor the visible
hint of flinching. If I were looking for a certain
type of specialized ability, I should say you had qualified.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flush spread on the face of the listener.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are indeed introducing me to some one I
haven&#8217;t known,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, too,&#8221; went on Snowdon, &#8220;that there has
been a girl&mdash;and,&#8221; he hastened to add as his companion
stiffened, &#8220;I mention her only to show you
that my observations have not been <i>too</i> superficial.
Those qualities which I have catalogued have engaged
my attention, because they are rare&mdash;rare enough to
be profitably capitalized.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All this is parable to me, sir.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Quite probably. I mean to construe it. There are
men who originate or discover great opportunities of
industry&mdash;and they need capital to bring their plans
to fruition&mdash;but capital can be approached only
through envoys and will receive only ambassadors who
can compel recognition. The man who can hope to be
successfully accredited to the court of Big Money
must possess uncommon attributes. Pinch-beck promoters
and plausible charlatans have made cynics of
our lords of wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would such a man accomplish,&#8221; inquired
Spurrier, &#8220;aside from a sort of non-resident membership
in the association of plutocrats?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would,&#8221; declared Snowdon promptly, &#8220;help
bridge the chasm between the world&#8217;s unfinanced
achievers, and its unachieving finances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; conceded the ex-soldier, &#8220;would be worth
the doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John Law at twenty-one built a scheme of finance
for Great Britain,&#8221; the engineer reminded him. &#8220;He
could come into the presence of a king and in five minutes
the king would urge him to stay. Force and presence
can make such an ambassador, and those things
are the veins of human ore I&#8217;ve assayed in you in
paying quantities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier looked across at the strange companion
whom chance had thrown across his path with a commotion
of pulses which his face in no wise mirrored
into outward expression. It had begun to occur to
him that if a man is born for an adventurous life
even the Articles of War cannot cancel his destiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would seem,&#8221; he suggested casually enough,
&#8220;that this need of which you speak is for fellows, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
finance, who can carry the message to Garcia, as it
were. Isn&#8217;t that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, and messengers to Garcia don&#8217;t tramp on
each other&#8217;s heels. Yet I have spoken of only one
phase of the career I&#8217;m outlining. It has another side
to it as well, if one man is going to unite in himself
the whole of the possibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdon broke off there a moment and seemed to
be distracted by some thought of his own, but presently
he began again.</p>
<p>&#8220;My hypothetical man would act largely as a free
lance, knocking about the world on a sort of constantly
renewed exploration. He would be the prospector
hunting gold and the explorer searching for
new continents of industrial development, only instead
of being just the one or the other he would be a
sort of sublimation. His job would sometimes call
him into the wildernesses, but more often, I think, his
discoveries would lie under the noses of crowds,
passed by every day by clever folk who never saw
them&mdash;clever folk who are not quite clever enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would seem to me that those discoveries,&#8221; demurred
Spurrier thoughtfully, &#8220;would come each time
to some highly trained technician in some particular
line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdon shook his head again. &#8220;That&#8217;s why they
have come slowly heretofore,&#8221; he declared with conviction.
&#8220;That man I have in mind is one with a
sure nose for the trail and a power of absorbing readily
and rapidly what he requires of the other man&#8217;s
technical knowledge. It&#8217;s the policy that Japan has
followed as a nation. They let others work the problems
out over there&mdash;then they appropriate the results.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
I&#8217;m not commending it as a national trait, but
for this work it&#8217;s the first essential. Having made
his discovery, this new type of business man will
enlist for it the needful financial support.&#8221; He paused
again and Spurrier, lighting a fresh cigarette, regarded
him through eyes slit-narrowed against the
flare of the match.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be a sort of opportunity hound,&#8221; continued
Snowdon smilingly. &#8220;He would go baying
across the world in full cry and come back to the kennel
at the end of each chase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier laughed. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll pardon me, sir,&#8221; he
hazarded, &#8220;you make a very bad metaphor. I should
fancy that the opportunity hound would do the stillest
sort of still hunting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The older man smiled and bowed his head affirmatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I accept the amendment. The point is, do I give
you the concept of the work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a broad, extremely sketchy way, I think I get
the picture,&#8221; replied Spurrier. &#8220;But could you give
me some sort of illustration that would make it a
shade more concrete?&#8221;</p>
<p>His companion sat considering the question for a
while and at last inquired: &#8220;Do you know anything
about oil? I mean about its production?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on the Pennsylvania Railroad, coming
west,&#8221; testified the former lieutenant. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve run
through ragged hills where on every side, stood
clumsy, timber affairs like overgrown windmills from
which some victorious Don Quizote had knocked off
the whirligigs. Then I&#8217;ve read a little of Ida Tarbell.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Even that will serve for a sort of background.
Now, people in general think of striking oil as they
might think of finding money on the sidewalk or of
lightning striking a particular spire&mdash;as a matter of
purest chance. To some extent that idea is correct
enough, but the brains of oil production are less haphazard.
In the office of a few gentlemen who hold
dominion over oil and gas hangs a map drawn by the
intelligence department of their general staff. On that
map are traced lines not unlike those showing ocean
currents, but their arrows point instead to currents
far under ground, where runs the crude petroleum,
discovered&mdash;and undiscovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Undiscovered?&#8221; Spurrier&#8217;s brows were lifted in
polite incredulity, but his companion nodded decisively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Discovered and undiscovered,&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;Geological surveys told the mapmakers how certain
lines and structures ran in tendency. Where went a
particular formation of Nature&#8217;s masonry, there in
probability would go oil. The method was not absolute,
I grant you, but neither was it haphazard. Sitting
in an office in Pittsburgh a certain man drew on his
chart what has since been recognized as the line of
the forty-second degree, running definitely from the
Pennsylvania fields down through Ohio and into the
Appalachian hills of Kentucky&mdash;thence west and
south. Study your fields in Oklahoma, in old Mexico,
and you will find that, widely separated as they are,
each of them is marked by a cross on that map, and
that each of them lies along the current trend which
the Pittsburgh man traced before many of them were
touched by a drill.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That, surely,&#8221; argued Spurrier, &#8220;testifies for the
highly skilled technician, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far. I now come to the chance of the opportunity
hound. The present fields are spots of production
here and there. Between them lie others,
virgin to pump or rig. Much of that ground is, of
course, barren territory, for even on an acre of proven
location dry holes may lie close to gushers; one
man&#8217;s farm may be a &#8216;duster&#8217; while his neighbor&#8217;s
spouts black wealth. But along that charted
line run the probabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Into Spurrier&#8217;s eyes stole the gleam of the adventuring
spirit that was strong in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds like Robert Louis Stevenson and buried
treasure,&#8221; he declared with unconcealed enthusiasm,
but Snowdon only smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; he cautioned, &#8220;I&#8217;m illustrating&mdash;nothing
more. Now in the foothills of the Kentucky
Cumberlands, for example, some years ago men began
finding oil. It lay for the most part in a country
where the roads were creek beds&mdash;remote from railway
facilities. It was an expensive sort of proposition
to develop, but the cry of &#8216;Oil! Oil!&#8217; has never
failed to set the pack a-running, and it ran.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember hearing of that rush,&#8221; admitted
Spurrier.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I dare say you didn&#8217;t. It was a flare-up and a
die-down. The men who rushed in, plodded dejectedly
out again, poorer by the time they had spent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the boom collapsed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It collapsed&mdash;but why? Because the gentlemen
who hold dominion over oil and gas caucussed and so
ordained. They gathered around their map and stuck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
pins here and there. They said, &#8216;This oil can come
out in two ways only: by pipe line or tank cars. We
will stand aloof and develop where the cost is less and
the profit greater&mdash;and without us, it cannot succeed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were there no independent concerns to bring the
stuff to market?&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdon laughed. &#8220;The gentlemen who hold dominion
have their own defenses against competition.
You may have heard of a certain dog in the manger?
Well, they said as they sat about their table on which
the map was spread, &#8216;Some day other fields may run
out. Some day something may set oil soaring until
even this yield may be well worth our attention. We
will therefore hold this card in reserve against that
day and that contingency.&#8217; So quietly, inconspicuously,
yet with a power that strangled competition,
lobbies operated in State legislatures. The independents
failed to secure needful charters&mdash;the lines were
never laid. Those particular fields starved, and now
the ignorant mountaineers who woke for a while to
dreams of wealth, laugh at the man who says &#8216;oil&#8217; to
them. Yet at some properly, or improperly designated
day, those failure fields will flash on the astonished
world as something risen from the dead, and
fortunes will blossom for the lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; prompted the listener.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let us suppose our opportunity hound as willing
to go unostentatiously into that country; as willing
to spend part of each year there for a term of
years; nipping options here and there, waiting patiently
and watching his chance to slip a charter
through one of those bound and gagged legislatures in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
some moment of relaxed vigilance. Such a man might
find himself ultimately standing with the key to the
situation in his own hand. It&#8217;s just a story, but perhaps
it serves to give you my meaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I understand you to suggest,&#8221; inquired Spurrier
with a forced calmness, &#8220;that you fancy you see
in me the qualities of your opportunity hound?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our own concern,&#8221; said Snowdon quietly, &#8220;is fortunate
enough to have passed through the period of
cooling its heels in the anterooms of capital, but we
can still use a man such as I have described. There&#8217;s
a place for you with us if you want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do I go to work?&#8221; demanded the former
lieutenant rising from his seat, and Snowdon countered:</p>
<p>&#8220;When will you be ready to begin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we dock at &#8217;Frisco,&#8221; came the immediate response,
&#8220;provided I be allowed time for an affair of
my own, two months from now. A certain private in
my old company will be discharged from the service
then. I fancy he&#8217;ll land there, and I want to be waiting
for him when he steps ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A reprisal?&#8221; inquired Snowdon in a disappointed
tone, but the other shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the one man through whom there&#8217;s a chance
of clearing my name,&#8221; Spurrier said slowly. &#8220;I hope
it won&#8217;t call for violence.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>Private Grant had been bred of the blood of
hatred and suckled in vindictiveness. He had
come into being out of the heritage of feud
fighting &#8220;foreparents,&#8221; and he thought in the terms of
his ancestry.</p>
<p>When he had fled into the jungle beyond the island
village, though he had been demented and enfeebled,
the instinct of a race that had often &#8220;hidden out&#8221;
guided him. That instinct and chance had led him to
a native house where his disloyalty gave him a welcome,
and there he had found sanctuary until his fever
subsided and he emerged cadaverous, but free. Word
had filtered through to him there of Spurrier&#8217;s court-martial
and its result.</p>
<p>In the course of time, fever-wasted yet restored out
of his semi-lunacy, he had made his way furtively
but successfully toward Manila and there he had supplemented
the sketchy fragments of information with
which his disloyal native friends had been able to provide
him.</p>
<p>He knew now that the accused officer had pitched
his defense upon an accusation of the deserter and
the refugee&#8217;s eyes smoldered as he learned that he
himself had been charged with prefacing his flight
with murder. He knew what that meant. The disgraced
officer would move heaven and earth to clear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
his smirched name, and the condition precedent would
be the capture of Private Grant and the placing of him
in the prisoner&#8217;s dock. To be wanted for desertion
was grave enough. To be wanted both for desertion
and the assassination of his company commander was
infinitely worse, and to stand in that position and face,
as he believed he would have to, a conspiracy of class
feeling, was intolerable.</p>
<p>Haunting the shadowy places about Manila, Grant
had been almost crazed by his fears but with the lifting
of the steamer&#8217;s anchor, a great spirit of hope had
brightened in him, feeding on the solace of the thought
that, once more in the States, he could lose himself
from pursuit and vigilance.</p>
<p>Then he had seen, on the same ship, the face of the
man whom, above all others, he had occasion to fear!</p>
<p>For their joint lives the world was not large
enough. One of them must die, and in the passion
that swept over him with the dread of discovery.
Grant had skirted a relapse into his recent mania.</p>
<p>At that moment when Spurrier had looked down
and he had looked up, the deserter had seen only one
way out, and that was to kill. But when the other had
moved away, seemingly without recognition, his
thoughts had moved more lucidly again.</p>
<p>Until he had tried soldiering he had known only
the isolated life of forested mountains and here on a
ship at sea he felt surrounded and helpless&mdash;almost
timid. When he landed at San Francisco, if his luck
held him undiscovered that long, he would have dry
land under him and space into which to flee.</p>
<p>The refugee had hated Comyn. Now Comyn was
dead and Grant transferred his hatred from the dead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
captain to the living lieutenant, resolving that he also
must die.</p>
<p>The moment to which he looked forward with the
most harrowing apprehension was that when the vessel
docked and put her passengers ashore. Here at
sea a comforting isolation lay between first and third
cabin passengers and one could remain unseen from
those deck levels that lay forward and above. But
with the arrangements for disembarkation, he was unfamiliar,
and for all he knew, the steerage people
might be herded along under the eyes of those who
traveled more luxuriously. He might have to march
in such a procession, willy-nilly, over a gang-plank
swept by a watchful eye.</p>
<p>So Private Grant brooded deeply and his thoughts
were not pretty. Also he kept his pistol near him and
when the hour for debarkation arrived he was ripe for
trouble.</p>
<p>It happened that a group of steerage passengers,
including himself, were gathered together much as he
had feared they might be, and Grant&#8217;s face paled and
hardened as he saw, leaning with his elbows on a rail
above him and a pipe in his mouth, the officer whom
he dreaded.</p>
<p>Grant&#8217;s hand slipped unobtrusively under his coat
and his eyes narrowed as his heart tightened and became
resolved.</p>
<p>Spurrier had not yet seen him but at any moment he
might do so. There was nothing to prevent the wandering
and casual glance from alighting on the spot
where the deserter stood, and when it did so the
mountaineer would draw and fire.</p>
<p>But as the ex-officer&#8217;s eyes went absently here and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
there a girl passed at his back and perhaps she spoke
as she passed. At all events the officer straightened
and stiffened. Across his face flashed swiftly such an
expression as might have come from a sudden and
stinging blow, and then, losing all interest in the bustle
of the lower decks, the man turned on his heel and
walked rapidly away.</p>
<p>The deserter&#8217;s hand stole away from the pistol
grip and his breath ran out in a long, sibilant gasp of
relief and reaction. When later he had landed safely
and unmolested, he turned in flight toward the mountains
that he knew over there across the continent&mdash;mountains
where only bloodhounds could run him to
earth.</p>
<p>Beyond the rims of those forest-tangled peaks he
had never looked out until he had joined the army, and
once back in them, though he dare not go, for a while,
to his own home county, he could shake off his palsy
of fear.</p>
<p>He traveled as a hobo, moneyless, ignorant, and unprepossessing
of appearance, yet before the leaves
began to fall he was at last tramping slopes where the
air tasted sweeter to his nostrils, and the speech of
mankind fell on his ear with the music of the accustomed.</p>
<p>The name of Bud Grant no longer went with him.
That, since it carried certain unfulfilled duties to an
oath of allegiance, he generously ceded to the United
States Army, and contented himself with the random
substitute of Sim Colby.</p>
<p>Now he tramped swingingly along a bowlder-broken
creek bed which by local euphemism was called
a road. When his way led him over the backbone of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
a ridge he could see, almost merged with the blue of
the horizon, the smoky purple of a sugar loaf peak,
which marked his objective.</p>
<p>When he passed that he would be in territory where
his journeying might end. To reach it he must
transverse the present vicinity in which a collateral
branch of his large family still dwelt, and where he
himself preferred to walk softly, wary of possible recognition.</p>
<p>To the man whose terror had seen in every casual
eye that rested on him while he crossed a continent,
a gleam of accusation, it was as though he had reached
sanctuary. The shoulders that he had forced into a
hang-dog slough to disguise the soldierly bearing which
had become habitual in uniform, came back into a
more buoyant and upright swing. The face that had
been sullen with fear now looked out with something
of the bravado of earlier days, and the whole experience
of the immediate past; of months and even years,
took on the unreality of a nightmare from which he
was waking.</p>
<p>The utmost of caution was still required, but the
long flight was reaching a goal where substantial
safety lay like a land of promise. It was a land of
promise broken with ragged ranges and it was
fiercely austere; the Cumberland mountains reared
themselves like a colossal and inhospitable wall of isolation
between the abundant richness of lowland Kentucky
to the west, and Virginia&#8217;s slope seaward to the
east.</p>
<p>But isolation spelled refuge and the taciturn silences
of the men who dwelt there, asking few questions and
answering fewer, gave promise of unmolested days.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>These hills were a world in themselves; a world
that had stood, marking time for a hundred and fifty
years, while to east and west life had changed and
developed and marched with the march of the years.
Sequestered by broken steeps of granite and sand
stone, the human life that had come to the coves and
valleys in days when the pioneers pushed westward,
had stagnated and remained unaltered.</p>
<p>Illiteracy and ignorance had sprung chokingly into
weed-like prevalence. The blood-feud still survived
among men who fiercely insisted upon being laws unto
themselves. Speech fell in quaint uncouthness that
belonged to another century, and the tides of progress
that had risen on either hand, left untouched and
uninfluenced the men and women of mountain blood,
who called their lowland brethren &#8220;furriners&#8221; and
who distrusted all that was &#8220;new-fangled&#8221; or
&#8220;fotched-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Habitations were widely separated cabins. Roads
were creekbeds. Life was meager and stern, and in
the labyrinths of honeycombed and forest-tangled
wilds, men who were &#8220;hidin&#8217; out&#8221; from sheriffs, from
revenuers, from personal enemies, had a sentimental
claim on the sympathy of the native-born.</p>
<p>This was the life from which the deserter had
sprung. It was the life to which with eager impatience
he was returning; a life of countless hiding places and
of no undue disposition to goad a man with questioning.</p>
<p>Through the billowing richness of the Bluegrass
lowlands, he had hurried with a homing throb in his
pulses. As the foothills began to break out of the fallow
meadows and the brush to tangle at the fringe of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
the smoothness, his breath had come deeper and more
satisfying. When the foothills rose in steepness until
low, wet streamers of cloud trailed their slopes like
shrapnel smoke, and the timber thickened and he saw
an eagle on the wing, something like song broke into
being in his heart.</p>
<p>He was home. Home in the wild mountains where
air and the water had zest and life instead of the
staleness that had made him sick in the flat world
from which he came. He was home in the mountains
where others were like him and he was not a barbarian
any longer among contemptuous strangers.</p>
<p>He plodded along the shale-bottomed water course
for a little way and halted. As his woodsman&#8217;s eye
took bearings he muttered to himself: &#8220;Hit&#8217;s a right
slavish way through them la&#8217;rel hills, but hit&#8217;s a cut-off,&#8221;
and, suiting his course to his decision, he turned
upward into the thickets and began to climb.</p>
<p>An hour later he had covered the &#8220;hitherside&#8221; and
&#8220;yon side&#8221; of a small mountain, and when he came to
the highway again he found himself confronted by a
half dozen armed horsemen whose appearance gave
him apprehensive pause, because at once he recognized
in them the officialdom of the law. The mounted
travelers drew rein, and he halted at the roadside,
nodding his greeting in affected unconcern.</p>
<p>The man who had been riding at the fore held in
his left hand the halter line of a led horse, and now he
looked down at the pedestrian and spoke in the familiar
phrase of wayside amenity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, stranger, what mout yore name be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sim Colby from acrost Hemlock Mountain ways,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
but I&#8217;ve done been west fer a year gone by, though, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m jest broguein&#8217; along to&#8217;rds home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The questioner, a long, gaunt man with a face that
had been scarred, but never altered out of its obstinate
set, eyed him for a moment, then shot out the question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did ye ever hear tell of Sam Mosebury over thet-away?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was lucky that the fugitive had given as his home
a territory with which he had some familiarity. Now
his reply came promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I knows him when I sees him. Some folks
used ter give him a right hard name over thar, but I
reckon he&#8217;s all right ef a man don&#8217;t aim ter crowd him
too fur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how fur he mout of been crowded,&#8221;
brusquely replied the man with the extra horse, &#8220;but
he kilt a man in Rattletown yestiddy noon an&#8217; tuck
ter ther woods. I&#8217;m after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foot traveler expressed an appropriate interest,
then added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Howsomever, hit ain&#8217;t none of my affair, an&#8217; seein&#8217;
thet I&#8217;ve got a right far journey ahead of me, I&#8217;ll
hike along.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the leader of the mounted group shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my men got horse flung back thar an&#8217; broke
a bone inside him. I&#8217;m ther high sheriff of this hyar
county, an&#8217; I hereby summons ye ter go along with
me an&#8217; ack as a member of my possy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under his tan Private Grant paled a little. This
mischance carried a triple menace to his safety. It
involved riding back to the county seat where some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
man might remember his face, and recall that two
years ago he had gone away on a three years&#8217; enlistment.
But even if he escaped that contingency, it
meant tarrying in this neighborhood through which
he had meant to pass inconspicuously and rapidly. To
be attached to a <i>posse comitatus</i> riding the hills on a
man hunt meant to challenge every passing eye with
an interest beyond the casual.</p>
<p>Finally, though he might well have forgotten him,
the man whose trail he was now called to take in pursuit
had once known him slightly, and if they met
under such hostile auspices, might recognize and denounce
him.</p>
<p>But the sheriff sat enthroned in his saddle and robed
in the color of authority. At his back sat five other
men with rifles across their pommels, and with such
a situation there was no argument. The law&#8217;s officer
threw the bridle rein of the empty-saddled mount to
the man in the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up on this critter,&#8221; he commanded tersely,
&#8220;and don&#8217;t let him git his head down too low. He
follers buck-jumpin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Grant, alias Colby, found that the men riding
with him were more disposed to somber silence
than to inquisitiveness or loquacity, he breathed easier.
He even made a shrewd guess that there were others
in that small group who answered the call of the law
as reluctantly as he.</p>
<p>Sam Mosebury was accounted as dangerous as a
rattlesnake, and Bud doubted whether even the high
sheriff himself would make more than a perfunctory
effort to come to grips with him in his present desperation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>When the posse had ridden several hours, and had
come to a spot in the forest where the trail forked
diversely, a halt was called. They had traveled steep
ways and floundered through many belly-deep fords.
Dust lay gray upon them and spattered mud overlaid
the dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done come ter a pass, now,&#8221; declared the
sheriff, &#8220;where hit ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter profit us no longer
ter go trailin&#8217; in one bunch. We hev need ter split
up an&#8217; turkey tail out along different routes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun had long crossed the meridian and dyed the
steep horizon with burning orange and violet when
Bud Grant and Mose Biggerstaff, with whom he had
been paired off, drew rein to let their horses blow in
a gorge between beetling walls of cliff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, I ain&#8217;t got no master relish for this task, no-how,&#8221;
declared Mose morosely as he spat at the black
loam of rotting leaves. &#8220;No man ain&#8217;t jedgmatically
proved ter me, yit, thet ther feller Sam kilt didn&#8217;t need
killin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bud nodded a solemn concurrence in the sentiment.
Then abruptly the two of them started as though at
the intrusion of a ghost and, of instinct, their hands
swept holsterward, but stopped halfway.</p>
<p>This sudden galvanizing of their apathy into life
was effected by the sight of a figure which had materialized
without warning and in uncanny silence in a
fissure where the rocks dripped from reeking moss
on either side.</p>
<p>It stood with a cocked repeating rifle held easily at
the ready, and it was a figure that required no heralding
of its identity or menace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were ye lookin&#8217; fer me, boys?&#8221; drawled Sam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
Mosebury with a palpable enjoyment of the situation,
not unlike that which brightens the eyes of a cat as it
plays with a mouse already crippled.</p>
<p>With swift apprehension the eyes of the two deputies
met and effected an understanding. Mose Biggerstaff
licked his bearded lips until their stiffness relaxed
enough for speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me an&#8217; Sim Colby hyar,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;got summoned
by ther high sheriff. We didn&#8217;t hev no rather
erbout hit one way ner t&#8217;other. All we&#8217;ve got ter go
on air ther <i>dee</i>scription thet war give ter us&mdash;an&#8217; we
don&#8217;t see no resemblance atween ye an&#8217; ther feller
we&#8217;re atter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The murderer stood eying them with an amused
contempt, and one could recognize the qualities of
dominance which, despite his infamies, had won him
both fear and admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef ye thinks ye&#8217;d ought ter take me along an&#8217; show
me ter yore high sheriff,&#8221; he suggested, and the finger
toyed with the trigger, &#8220;I&#8217;m right hyar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afore God, no!&#8221; It was Bud who spoke now
contradicting his colleague. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seed Sam Mosebury
often times&mdash;an&#8217; ye don&#8217;t no fashion faver him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seed ye afore, too, I reckon,&#8221;
he commented dryly. &#8220;But ef ye don&#8217;t know me, I
reckon I don&#8217;t need ter know <i>you</i>, nuther.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two sat atremble in their saddles until the apparition
had disappeared in the laurel.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Gray-templed and seamed of face, Dyke Cappeze
entered the courthouse at Carnettsville one day a few
months later and paused for a moment, his battered
law books under his threadbare elbow, to gaze around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
the murky hall of which his memory needed no refreshing.</p>
<p>About the stained walls hung fly-specked notices of
sheriff&#8217;s sales, and between them stamped long-haired,
lean-visaged men drawn in by litigation or jury service
from branchwater and remote valley.</p>
<p>Out where the sun lay mellow on the town square
was the brick pavement, on which Cappeze&#8217;s law partner
had fallen dead ten years ago, because he dared
to prosecute too vigorously. Across the way stood
the general store upon which one could still see the
pock-marking of bullets reminiscent of that day when
the Heatons and the Blacks made war, and terrorized
the county seat.</p>
<p>Dyke Cappeze looked over it all with a deep melancholy
in his eyes. He knew his mountains and loved
his people whose virtues were more numerous, if less
conspicuous, than their sins. In his heart burned a
militant insurgency. These hills cried out for development,
and development demanded a conception of
law broader gauged and more serious than obtained.
It needed fearless courts, unterrified juries, intrepid
lawyers.</p>
<p>He had been such a lawyer, and when he had applied
for life insurance he had been adjudged a prohibitive
risk. To-day the career of three decades was
to end, and as the bell in the teetering cupola began to
clang its summons he shook his head&mdash;and pressed
tight the straight lips that slashed his rugged face.</p>
<p>On the bench sat the circuit-riding judge of that
district; a man to whom, save when he addressed him
as &#8220;your honor,&#8221; Dyke Cappeze had not spoken in
three years. They were implacable enemies, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
too often the lawyer had complained that justice
waited here on expediency.</p>
<p>Cappeze looked at the windows bleared with their
residue of dust and out through them at the hills
mantling to an autumnal glory. Then he heard that
suave&mdash;to himself he said hypocritical&mdash;voice from
the bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen of the bar, any motions?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wearily the thin, tall-framed lawyer came to his
feet and stood erect and silent for a moment in his
long, black coat, corroding into the green of dilapidation.</p>
<p>&#8220;May it please your honor,&#8221; he grimly declared. &#8220;I
hardly know whether my statement may be properly
called a motion or not. It&#8217;s more a valedictory.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew from his breast pocket a bit of coarse,
lined writing paper and waved it in his talon-like hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was retained by the widow Sales, whose husband
was shot down by Sam Mosebury, to assist the prosecution
in bringing the assassin to punishment. The
grand jury has failed to indict this defendant. The
sheriff has failed to arrest him. The court has failed
to produce those witnesses whom I have subp&oelig;naed.
The machinery of the law which is created for the
sole purpose of protecting the weak against the encroachments
of the malevolent has failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, and through the crowded room the
shuffling feet fell silent and heads bent excitedly forward.
Then Cappeze lifted the paper in his hand and
went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hold here an unsigned letter that threatens me
with death if I persist with this prosecution. It came
to me two weeks ago, and since receiving it I have redoubled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
my energy. When this grand jury was impaneled
and charged, such a note also reached each
of its members. I know not what temper of soul
actuates those men who have sworn to perform the
duties of grand jurors. I know not whether these
threats have affected their deliberations, but I know
that they have failed to return a true bill against Sam
Mosebury!&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge fingering his gavel frowned gravely.
&#8220;Does counsel mean to charge that the court has
proven lax?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to say,&#8221; declared the lawyer in a voice that
suddenly mounted and rung like a trumpeted challenge,
&#8220;that in these hills of Kentucky the militant
spirit of the law seems paralyzed! I mean to say that
terrorism towers higher than the people&#8217;s safeguards!
For a lifetime I have battled here to put the law above
the feud&mdash;and I have failed. In this courthouse my
partner fought for a recognition of justice and at its
door he paid the penalty with his life. I wish to make
no charges other than to state the facts. I am growing
old, and I have lost heart in a vain fight. I wish
to withdraw from this case as associate commonwealth
counsel, because I can do nothing more than
I have done, and that is enough. I wish to state publicly
that to-day I shall take down my shingle and
withdraw from the practice of law, because law
among us seems to me a misnomer and a futile semblance.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a dead silence the elderly attorney came to his
period and gathered up again under his threadbare
elbow his two or three battered books. Turning, he
walked down the center aisle toward the door, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
as he went his head sagged dejectedly forward on his
chest.</p>
<p>He heard the instruction of his enemy on the bench,
still suave:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Clerk, let the order be entered striking the
name of Mr. Cappeze from the record as associate
counsel for the commonwealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was early forenoon when the elderly attorney
left the dingy law office which he was closing, and the
sunset fires were dying when he swung himself down
from the saddle at his own stile in the hills and walked
between the bee-gums and bird boxes to his door.
But before he reached it the stern pain in his eyes
yielded to a brightening thought, and as if responsive
to that thought the door swung open and in it stood
a slim girl with eyes violet deep, and a beauty so alluring
and so wildly natural that her father felt as if
youth had met him again, when he had begun to think
of all life as musty and decrepit with age.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>Except in that narrow circle of American life
which follows the doings and interests of the
army and navy, the world had forgotten, in the
several years since its happening, the court-martial
and disgrace of John Spurrier&mdash;but Spurrier himself
had not been able to forget.</p>
<p>His name had become forcefully identified with
other things and, in the employ of Snowdon&#8217;s company,
he had been into those parts of the world which
call to a man of energy and constructive ability of
major calibre. But the joy of seeing mine fields open
to the rush where there had been only desert before:
of seeing chasms bridged into roadways had not been
enough to banish the brooding which sprung from
the old stigma. In remote places he had encountered
occasional army men to remind him that he was no
longer one of them and, though he was often doing
worthier things than they, they were bound by regulations
which branded him.</p>
<p>So Spurrier had hardened, not into outward crustiness
of admitted chagrin, but with an inner congealing
of spirit which made him look on life as a somewhat
merciless fight and what he could wrest from life as
the booty of conquest.</p>
<p>One day, in Snowdon&#8217;s office after a more than usually
difficult task had reached accomplishment, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
chief candidly proclaimed justification for his first
estimate of his aide, and Spurrier smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s generous of you to speak so, sir,&#8221; he said
slowly, &#8220;and I&#8217;m glad to leave you with that impression&mdash;because
with many regrets I <i>am</i> leaving you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The older man raised his brows in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had hoped our association would be permanent,&#8221;
he responded. &#8220;I suppose, though, you have an opening
to a broader horizon. If so it comes as recognition
well earned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an offer from Martin Harrison, sir,&#8221; came the
reply in slowly weighed words. &#8220;There are objections,
of course, but the man who gains Harrison&#8217;s
confidence stands in the temple of big money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Of course Harrison&#8217;s name needs no amplification.&#8221;
The man who had opened a door for
Spurrier in what had seemed a blank wall, sat for a
moment silent then broke out with more than his
customary emphasis of expression. &#8220;Objection from
me may seem self-interested because I am losing a
valuable assistant. But&mdash;damn it all, Harrison is a
pirate!&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier&#8217;s tanned cheeks flushed a shade darker but
he nodded his head. His fine eyes took on that glint
of hardness which, in former times, had never marred
their engaging candor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have you understand me, sir. I owe
you that much and a great deal more. I know that
Harrison and his ilk of big money operators are none
too scrupulous&mdash;but they have power and opportunity
and those are things I must gain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had supposed,&#8221; suggested Snowdon deliberately,
&#8220;that you wanted two things above all else. First to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
establish your innocence to the world, and secondly,
even if you failed in that, to make your name so substantially
respected that you could bear&mdash;the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until recently I had no other thought.&#8221; The
young man rose and stood with his fine body erect and
as full of disciplined strength as that of a Praxiteles
athlete. Then he took several restless turns across
the floor and halted tensely before his benefactor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have let no grass grow under my feet. You
know how I have run down every conceivable clue and
how I stand as uncleared as the day the verdict was
brought at Manila. I&#8217;ve begun to despair of vindication....
I am not by nature a beast of prey.... I
prefer fair play and the courtesies of sportsmanlike
conflict.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, then went forward again in a hardening
voice: &#8220;But in this land of ours there are two aristocracies
and only two&mdash;and I want to be an aristocrat
of sorts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize we had even so much variety as
that,&#8221; observed Snowdon and the younger man continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real aristocracy is that of gentle blood and
ideals. Our little army is its true nucleus and there a
man doesn&#8217;t have to be rich. I was born to that and
reared to it as to a deep religion&mdash;but I&#8217;ve been cast
out, unfrocked, cashiered. I can&#8217;t go back. One
class is still open to me; the brazen, arrogant circles
of wealth into which a double-fisted achiever can
bruise his way. I don&#8217;t love them. I don&#8217;t revere
them, but they offer power and I mean to take my place
on their tawdry eminence. It&#8217;s all that&#8217;s left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not preaching humility,&#8221; persisted Snowdon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
quietly. &#8220;I started you along the paths of financial
combat and I see no fault in your continuing, but may
I be candid to the point of bluntness?&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused for permission and Spurrier prompted:
&#8220;Yes, please go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; finished Snowdon, &#8220;since you&#8217;ve been with
me I&#8217;ve watched you grow&mdash;and you <i>have</i> grown.
But I&#8217;ve also seen a fine chivalric sense gradually
blunting; a generous predisposition hardening out of
flexibility into something more implacable, less gracious.
It&#8217;s a pity&mdash;and Martin Harrison won&#8217;t soften
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a while Spurrier stood meditatively silent, then
he smiled and once more nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a thing you&#8217;ve said that isn&#8217;t true, Mr.
Snowdon, and you&#8217;re the one man who could say it
without any touch of offensiveness. I&#8217;ve counted the
costs. God knows if I could go back to the army to-morrow
with a shriven record, I&#8217;d rather have my
lieutenant&#8217;s pay than all the success that could ever
come from moneyed buccaneers! But I can&#8217;t do that.
I can&#8217;t think of myself as a fighting man under my
own flag whose largest pay is his contentment and his
honor. Very well, I have accepted Hobson&#8217;s choice.
I will join that group which fights with power, for
power; the group that&#8217;s strong enough to defy the
approval they can&#8217;t successfully court. I <i>have</i> hardened
but I&#8217;ve needed to. I hope I shan&#8217;t become so
flagrant, however, that you&#8217;ll have to regret sponsoring
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snowdon laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of that,&#8221; he made hasty assurance.
&#8220;And my friendliest wishes go with you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>Since that day John Spurrier had come to a place
of confidence in the counsels over which Harrison
presided with despotic authority.</p>
<p>The man in the street, deriving his information
from news print, would have accorded Martin Harrison
a place on the steering committee of the country&#8217;s
wealth and affairs, and in such a classification he
would have been both right and wrong.</p>
<p>There were exclusive coteries of money manipulation
to which Harrison was denied an entree. These
combinations were few but mighty, and until he won
the sesame of admission to their supreme circle his
ambition must chafe, unsatisfied: his power, greater
than that of many kings, must seem to himself too
weak.</p>
<p>It must not be inferred that Harrison was embittered
by the wormwood of failure. His trophies of
success were numerous and tangible enough for every
purpose except his own contentment.</p>
<p>To-night he was smiling with baronial graciousness
while he stood welcoming a group of dinner guests in
his own house, and as his butler passed the tray of
canapes and cocktail glasses the latest arrival presented
himself.</p>
<p>The host nodded. &#8220;Spurrier,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think you
know every one here, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man who had just come was perfectly
tailored and self-confident of bearing, and as vigorous
of bodily strength as a wrestler in training. The time
that had passed over him since he had left Snowdon&#8217;s
company for wider and more independent fields had
wrought changes in him, and in so far as the observer
could estimate values from the externals of life, every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
development had been upward toward improvement.
Yet, between the man&#8217;s impressive surface and his soul
lay an acquired coat of cynicism and a shell of cultivated
selfishness.</p>
<p>John Spurrier, who had renounced the gaming
table, was more passionately and coldly than ever the
plunger, dedicated to the single religion of ambition.
He had failed to remove the blot of the court-martial
from his name, and, denied the soldier&#8217;s ethical place,
he had become a sort of moss-trooper of finance.</p>
<p>Backed only by his personal qualifications, he had
won his way into a circle of active wealth, and though
he seemed no more a stranger there than a duckling
in a pool, he himself knew that another simile would
more truly describe his status.</p>
<p>He was like an exhibition skater whose eye-filling
feats are watched with admiration and bated breath.
His evolutions and dizzy pirouettings were performed
with an adroit ease and grace, but he could feel the
swaying of the thin ice under him and could never
forget that only the swift smoothness of his flight
stood between himself and disaster.</p>
<p>He must live on a lavish scale or lose step with the
fast-moving procession. He must maintain appearances
in keeping with his associations&mdash;or drop downscale
to meaner opportunities and paltrier prizes. The
wealth which would establish him firmly seemed always
just a shade farther away than the reach of his
outstretched grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were just talking about Trabue, Spurrier,&#8221;
his host enlightened him as he looked across the rim
of his lifted glass, with eyes hardening at the mention
of that name.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>Spurrier did not ask what had been said about Trabue,
but he guessed that it savored of anathema. For
Trabue, whose name rarely appeared in the public announcements
of American Oil and Gas, was none the
less the white-hot power and genius of that organization&mdash;its
unheralded chief of staff. Just as A. O.
and G. dominated the world of finance, so he dominated
A. O. and G.</p>
<p>Harrison laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a vindictive man,&#8221; he
declared in humorous self-defense, &#8220;but I want his
scalp as Salome wanted the head of John the Baptist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The newly arrived guest smiled quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a large order, Mr. Harrison,&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;and yet it&#8217;s in line with a matter I want to
take up with you. My conspiracy won&#8217;t exactly separate
O. H. Trabue from his scalp lock, but it may pull
some pet feathers out of his war bonnet. I&#8217;m leaving
to-morrow on a mission of reconnaissance&mdash;and
when I come back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the elder and younger engaged with a
quiet interchange of understanding, and Spurrier
knew that into Martin&#8217;s mind, as crowded with activities
as a busy harbor, an idea had fallen which
would grow into interest.</p>
<p>When dinner was announced, the adventurer de
luxe&mdash;for it was so that he recognized himself in the
confessional of his own mind&mdash;took in the daughter
of his host, and this mark of distinction did not escape
the notice of several men.</p>
<p>Spurrier himself was gravely listening to some low-voiced
aside from the girl who nibbled at an olive, and
who merited his attention.</p>
<p>She was tall and undeniably handsome, and if her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
mentality sparkled with a cool and brilliant light rather
than a warm and appealing glow, that was because she
had inherited the pattern of her father&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>If, notwithstanding her wealth and position, she
was still unmarried three seasons after her coming-out,
it was her own affair and possibly his good fortune.
For when the Jack Spurrier of these days contemplated
marriage at all, he thought of it as an aid to
his career rather than a sentimental adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving in the morning,&#8221; he was saying in a
low voice, &#8220;for the Kentucky Cumberlands, where I&#8217;m
told life hasn&#8217;t changed much since the pioneers
crossed over their divide. It&#8217;s the Land of Do-Without.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Land of Do-Without?&#8221; she repeated after him.
&#8220;It&#8217;s an expressive phrase, Jack. Is it your own or
should there be quotation marks?&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier laughed as he admitted: &#8220;I claim no credit;
I merely quote, but the land down there in the steeps
is one, from all I hear, to stir the imagination into
terms more or less poetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned forward a little and his engaging face
mirrored his own interest so that the girl found herself
murmuring: &#8220;Tell me something about it, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; he assured her, &#8220;a stretch of unaltered
mediævalism entirely surrounded by modernity&mdash;yet
holding aloof. Though the country has spread to the
Pacific and it lies within three hundred miles of Atlantic
tidewater, it is still our one frontier where
pioneers live under the conditions that obtained in the
days of the Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems difficult to grasp,&#8221; she demurred, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
he nodded his head, abstractedly sketching lines on the
damask cloth with his oyster fork.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the nation was born,&#8221; he enlightened, &#8220;and
the questing spirit of the overland voyagers asserted
itself, the bulk of its human tide flowed west along
the Wilderness Road. Through Cumberland Gap lay
their one discovered gate in the wall that nature had
built to the sky across their path. It was a wall more
ancient than that of the Alps and between the ridges
many of them were stranded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; she demanded, arrested by the vibrant interest
of his own voice, and he continued with a
shrug of the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many reasons. A pack mule fallen lame&mdash;a
broken wagon-wheel; small things were enough in such
times of hardship to make a family settle where it
found itself balked. The more fortunate won through
to &#8216;take the west with the axe and hold it with the
rifle.&#8217; Then came railroads and steamboats, going
other ways, and the ridges were swallowed again by
the wilderness. The stranded brethren remained
stranded and they did not alter or progress. They
remained self-willed, fiercely independent and dedicated
to the creed &#8216;Leave us alone.&#8217; Their life to-day
is the life of two centuries ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl lifted the brows that were dark enough
to require no penciling.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the speech of a dreamer and a poet, Jack,
and I thought you the most practical of men. What
calls you into a land of poverty? I didn&#8217;t know you
ever ran on cold trails.&#8221; She spoke with a delicately
shaded irony, as though for the materialism of his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
viewpoint, yet he knew that her interest in him would
survive no failure of worldly attainment.</p>
<p>He did not repeat to her the story told him so long
ago by Snowdon, the engineer, nor confide to her that
ever since then his mind had harked back insistently
to that topic and its possibilities. Now he only smiled
with diplomatic suavity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pearls,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t feed oysters into robustness.
They make &#8217;em most uncomfortable. The
poverty-stricken illiterates in these hills, where I&#8217;m
going, might starve for centuries over buried treasure&mdash;which
some one else might find.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the stories,&#8221; she answered, though she did not
seem disturbed at the thought, &#8220;the stranger in the
Cumberlands always arouses the ire of some whiskered
moonshiner and falls in a creek bed pierced by a
shot from the laurel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or he falls in love with a barefoot Diana and
teaches her to adore him in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Harrison made a satirical little grimace. &#8220;At
least teach her to eat with a fork, too, Jack,&#8221; she
begged him. &#8220;It will contribute to your fastidious
comfort when you come back here to sell your pearls
at Tiffany&#8217;s or in Maiden Lane, or wherever it is that
one wholesales his treasure-trove.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>If John Spurrier had presented the picture of a
man to the manner born as he sat with Martin Harrison&#8217;s
daughter at Martin Harrison&#8217;s table, he fitted
into the ensemble, too, a week later, as he crossed the
hard-tramped dirt of the street from the railway station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
at Waterfall and entered the shabby tavern
over the way&mdash;for the opportunity hound must be
adaptable.</p>
<p>Here he would leave the end of the rails and travel
by mule into a wilder country, for on the geological
survey maps that he carried with him he had made
tracings of underground currents which it had not
been easy to procure.</p>
<p>These red-inkings were exact miniatures of a huge
wall chart in the headquarters of American Oil and
Gas, and to others than a trusted few they were not
readily accessible. How Spurrier had achieved his
purpose is a separate story and one over which he
smiled inwardly, though it may have involved features
that were not nicely ethical.</p>
<p>The tavern had been built in the days when Waterfall
had attracted men answering the challenge of oil
discovery. Now it had fallen wretchedly into decay,
and over it brooded the depression of hopes and
dreams long dead. Gladly Spurrier had left that town
behind him.</p>
<p>Now, on a crisp afternoon, when the hill slopes were
all garbed in the rugged splendor of the autumn&#8217;s
high color, he was tramping with a shotgun on his
elbow and a borrowed dog at his heels. He had
crossed Hemlock Mountain and struck into the hinterland
at its back.</p>
<p>Until now he had thought of Hemlock Mountain
as a single peak, but he had discovered it to be, instead,
an unbroken range beginning at Hell&#8217;s Door and
ending at Praise the Lord, which zigzagged for
a hundred miles and arched its bristling backbone
two thousand feet into the sky. Along this entire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
length it offered only a few passes over which a
traveler could cross except on foot or horseback.</p>
<p>He had found entertainment overnight at a clay-chinked
log-cabin, where he had shared the single
room with six human beings and two dogs. This
census takes no account of a razor-back pig which
was segregated in a box under the dining table, where
its feeding with scraps simplified the problem of
stock raising.</p>
<p>His present objective was the house of Dyke Cappeze,
the retired lawyer, whose name had drifted into
talk at every town in which he had stopped along the
railroad.</p>
<p>Cappeze was a &#8220;queer fellow,&#8221; a recluse who had
quit the villages and drawn far back into the hills
themselves. He was one who could neither win nor
stop fighting; who wanted to change the unalterable,
and, having failed, sulked like Achilles in his tent.
But whoever spoke of Cappeze credited him with being
a positive and unique personality, and Spurrier meant
to know him.</p>
<p>So he pretended to hunt quail&mdash;in a country where
a covey rose and scattered beyond gorges over which
neither dog nor man could follow. One excuse served
as well as another so long as he seemed sufficiently
careless of the things which were really the core and
center of his interest. And now Cappeze&#8217;s place ought
to be near by.</p>
<p>Off to one side of the ragged way stretched a brown
patch of stubble, and suddenly the dog stopped at its
edge, lifted his muzzle with distended nostrils delicately
aquiver, and then went streaking away into the rattling
weed stalks, eagerly quartering the bare field.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>Spurrier followed, growling skeptically to himself:
&#8220;He&#8217;s made a stand on a rabbit. That dog&#8217;s a liar and
the truth is not in him!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the setter had come to a halt and held motionless,
his statuesque pose with one foreleg uplifted as
rigid as a piece of bronze save for the black muzzle
sensitively alert and tremulous.</p>
<p>Then as the man walked in there came that startling
little thunder of whirring wings with which quail
break cover.</p>
<p>The ground seemed to burst with a tiny drumming
eruption of up-surging feathery shapes, and Spurrier&#8217;s
gun spoke rapidly from both barrels. Save for the
two he had downed, the covey crossed a little rise
beyond a thicket of blackberry brier where he marked
them by the tips of a few gnarled trees, and the man
nodded his head in satisfaction as the dog he had
libeled neatly retrieved his dead birds and cast off
again toward the hummock&#8217;s ridge.</p>
<p>Spurrier, following more slowly, lost sight of his
setter and, before he had caught up, he heard a
whimpering of fright and pain. Puzzled, he hastened
forward until from a slight elevation, which commanded
a burial ground, choked with a tangle of
brambles and twisted fox grapes, he found himself
looking on a picture for which he was entirely unprepared.</p>
<p>His dog was crouching and crawling in supplication,
while above him, with eyes that snapped lightning
jets of fury, stood a slender girl with a hickory
switch tightly clenched in a small but merciless hand.</p>
<p>As the gunner came into sight she stood her ground,
a little startled but obdurately determined, and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
expression appeared to transfer her anger from the
animal she had whipped to the master, until he almost
wondered whether she might not likewise use the
hickory upon him.</p>
<p>He tried not to let the vivid and unexpected beauty
of the apparition cloud his just indignation, and his
voice was stern with offended dignity as he demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me why you&#8217;re mistreating
my dog? He&#8217;s the gentlest beast I ever knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was straight and slim and as colorful as
the landscape which the autumn had painted with
crimson and violet, but in her eyes flamed a war fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that a-bulgin&#8217; out yore coat pocket, thar?&#8221;
she demanded breathlessly. &#8220;You an&#8217; yore dog air
both murderers! Ye&#8217;ve been shootin&#8217; into my gang of
pet pa&#8217;tridges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pet&mdash;partridges?&#8221; He repeated the words in a
mystified manner, as under the compulsion of her
gaze he drew out the incriminating bodies of the
lifeless victims.</p>
<p>The girl snatched the dead birds from him and laid
their soft breasts against her cheek, crooning sorrowfully
over them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They trusted me ter hold &#8217;em safe,&#8221; she declared in
a grief-stricken tone. &#8220;I&#8217;d kept all the gunners from
harmin&#8217; &#8217;em&mdash;an&#8217; now they&#8217;ve done been betrayed&mdash;an&#8217;
murdered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; declared Spurrier humbly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know they were pets. They behaved very much like
wild birds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog rose from his cowering position and came
over to shelter himself behind Spurrier, who just then
heard the underbrush stir at his back and wheeled to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
find himself facing an elderly man with a ruggedly
chiseled face and a mane of gray hair. It was a face
that one could not see without feeling a spirit force
behind it, and when the man spoke his sonorous voice,
too, carried a quality of impressiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have no way of knowin&#8217;, Glory,&#8221; he said
placatingly to the girl. &#8220;Bob Whites are mostly wild,
you know.&#8221; Then turning back to the man again he
courteously explained: &#8220;She fed this gang through
last winter when the snows were heavy. They&#8217;d come
up to the door yard an&#8217; peck &#8217;round with the chickens.
She&#8217;s gifted with the knack of gentlin&#8217; wild things.&#8221;
He paused, then added with a grim touch of irony.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lesson that it would have profited me to learn&mdash;but
I never could master it. You&#8217;re a furriner hereabouts,
ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is John Spurrier,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;I
was looking for Dyke Cappeze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Dyke Cappeze,&#8221; said the elderly man, &#8220;an&#8217; this
is my daughter, Glory. Come inside. Yore welcome
needs some mendin&#8217;, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>As John Spurrier followed his host between rhododendron
thickets that rose above their heads,
he found himself wondering what had become
of the girl, but when they drew near to an old house
whose stamp of orderly neatness proclaimed its contrast
to the scattering hovels of widely separated
neighbors, he caught a flash of blue gingham by the
open door and realized that the Valkyrie had taken a
short cut.</p>
<p>The dog, too, had arrived there ahead of its master
and was fawning now on the girl, who leaned impulsively
over to take the gentle-pointed muzzle between
her palms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I whopped ye,&#8221; she declared in a silver-voiced
contrition that made the man think of thrush
notes. &#8220;Hit wasn&#8217;t <i>yore</i> fault no-how. Hit was thet&mdash;thet
stuck-up furriner. I <i>hates</i> him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The setter waved its plumed tail in forgiveness and
contentment, and the girl, discovering with an upward
glance that she had been overheard, rose and stood for
a moment defiantly facing the object of her denunciation,
then, as embarrassment flooded her cheeks with
color, fled into the house.</p>
<p>The sense of having stepped back into an older century
had been growing on John Spurrier ever since
he had turned away from the town of Waterfall, and
now it possessed him with a singular fascination.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>Here was a different world, somber under its
shadow of frugality, and breathing out the heavy atmosphere
of isolation. The spirit of this strange life
looked out from the wearied eyes of Dyke Cappeze as
he sat filling his pipe across the hearth, a little later,
and it sounded in his voice when he announced slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not for me to withhold hospitality in a land
where a ready welcome is about all we have to offer,
and yet you could hardly have picked a worse house
to come to between the Virginia border and the Kaintuck
ridges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier raised his brows interrogatively, and at the
same moment he noticed matters hitherto overlooked.
The windows were heavily shuttered and his host sat
beyond the line of vision from the open door&mdash;with
a rifle leaning an arm&#8217;s length away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming as a stranger,&#8221; continued Cappeze, &#8220;you
start without enmities&mdash;with a clean page. You might
spend your life here and find a sincere welcome everywhere&mdash;so
long as you avoided other men&#8217;s controversies.
But you come to me and that, sir, is a bad
beginning&mdash;a very bad beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>A contemplative cloud of smoke went up from the
pipe, and the voice finished in a tone of bitterness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the most hated man in this region where
hatreds grow like weeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean because you have stood out for the enforcement
of law?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other nodded, &#8220;It has taken me a lifetime,&#8221; he
observed, &#8220;to learn that the mountains are stronger,
if not more obstinate, than I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the only reason they hate you?&#8221; inquired
the visitor, and the lawyer, removing the pipe stem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
from his teeth, regarded him for a space in silence.
Then he commented quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you knew this country better, you wouldn&#8217;t
have to ask that question. In Athens, I believe, they
ostracized Aristides because he was &#8216;too just a man.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonetheless, I&#8217;m glad I came to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cappeze smiled gravely. He had a rude sort of
dignity which Spurrier found beguiling; a politeness
that sprang from a deeper rooting than mere formula.</p>
<p>&#8220;Merely coming to see me&mdash;once in a while&mdash;won&#8217;t
damn you, I reckon. A man has a license to be interested
in freaks. But take my advice, and I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be
offended. Tell every one that you hold no brief for
me and listen with an open mind when they blackguard
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier laughed. &#8220;In a place where assassination
is said to come cheap, you have at least been able to
take care of yourself, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said the other slowly, &#8220;is as it happens. My
partner was less lucky. My own luck may break some
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you go on living here when you&#8217;d be safe
enough anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I go on living here. It&#8217;s a land where a man&#8217;s
mind starves and where the great marching song of
the world&#8217;s progress is silent&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Again
he paused to draw in and exhale a cloud of pipe
smoke. &#8220;Yet there&#8217;s something in the winds that blow
here, in the air one breathes, that &#8216;is native to my
blood.&#8217; Elsewhere I should be miserable, sir, and my
daughter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He came to an abrupt stop and Spurrier took him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
up quickly. &#8220;She seems young and vital enough to
crave all of life&#8217;s variety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she is contented, sir.&#8221; The elderly man spoke
eagerly as though to convince himself and quiet troubling
doubts. &#8220;She, too, would rather be here. We
know this life and take it as we find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier felt that the conversation was tending into
channels too personal for the participation of a chance
acquaintance, and he guided it to a less intimate subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand, Mr. Cappeze, that in the campaign
just ended, you stumped this district whole-heartedly
in behalf of one of the candidates for the circuit
judgeship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the hawk-keen blaze flared in the eyes of his
host.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, sir,&#8221; he declared with heated
emphasis. &#8220;It was less <i>for</i> a candidate than <i>against</i>
one that I worked. The man whom circumstances
compelled me to support was a poor thing, but he was
better than his adversary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it party spirit that prompted you, then?&#8221; inquired
the guest, feeling that politeness called for
some show of interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think,&#8221; said the lawyer with a grim
smile, &#8220;that from some men God withholds the blessed
power of riding life&#8217;s waves. All they can do is to
buffet and fight and wear themselves out. Perhaps
I&#8217;m that sort. The man who won&mdash;who succeeded
himself on the bench&mdash;is an expedientist. So long as
he presides, timid juries will return timid verdicts
and the law will falter. I took the stump to brand
him before the people as an apostate to his oath. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
knew he would win, but I meant to make him wear his
trade-mark of cowardice along with his smirk of self-righteousness!&#8221;</p>
<p>As Spurrier listened, not to a feudist but to a man
who had worn himself out fighting feudism, there
came to him like a revelation an appreciation of the
bitterness which runs in the grim undertow of this
blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; he suggested, glancing sidewise at the
door beyond which he heard the thrushlike voice of
the girl, &#8220;that you made an issue of a murder case
which collapsed&mdash;a case in which you had been employed
to prosecute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Cappeze told him. &#8220;Because I believe it to
be one in which the officers of the court lay down and
quit like dogs. The defendant was a red-handed
bully, generally feared&mdash;and the law was in timid
keeping. I am still trying to have the grand jury call
before it the prosecutor, the sheriff, and every deputy
who served on that posse. I want to make them tell,
on oath, just how hard they sought to apprehend the
assassin&mdash;who still walks boldly and freely among us&mdash;unwhipped
of justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier rose, deeply impressed by the headstrong,
willful courage of this old insurgent, whose daughter&#8217;s
eyes were so full of spring gentleness.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Far up the dwindling thread of a small water
course, where the forest was jungle-thick, a log cabin
hung perched to a rocky cornfield that tilted like a
steep roof, and under its shingles Sim Colby dwelt
alone. Since his coming here he had been assimilated
into the commonplace life of the neighborhood and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
the question of his origin was no longer discussed.
The time had gone by when even an acquaintance of
other days would be apt to calculate that his term of
enlistment in the army had not run its full course.
Moreover, there were no such acquaintances here;
none who had known him before he changed his name
from Grant to Colby. The shadow of dread which
had once obsessed him had gradually and imperceptibly
lightened until for weeks together he forgot how
poignantly it had once haunted him. He had painstakingly
established a reputation exemplary beyond
the tendencies of his nature in this new habitat&mdash;since
trouble might cause closed pages to reopen.</p>
<p>Now on a November afternoon a deputy sheriff,
serving summonses in that neighborhood dismounted
at the door where Sim stood with his hand resting
on the jamb, and the two mulled over what sparse
gossip the uneventful neighborhood afforded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Cappeze, he&#8217;s a-seekin&#8217; ter rake up hell afresh
an&#8217; brew more pestilence fer everybody,&#8221; announced
the deputy glumly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he projeckin&#8217; at now?&#8221; asked Sim.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s seekin&#8217; ter warm over thet ancient Sam Mosebury
case afore ther grand jury. Come ter think of
hit, Sim, ye rid with ther high sheriff yoreself thet
time, didn&#8217;t ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>Moodily the other nodded. That was a matter he
preferred to leave buried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Waal, Cappeze is claimin&#8217; now thet ther possy
didn&#8217;t make no master effort ter lay hands on Sam.
He aims ter hev all ye boys tell ther grand jury what
ye knows erbout ther matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy turned away, but in afterthought he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
paused, thrashing idly with his switch at the weed
stalks, as he retailed an almost forgotten item of
news.</p>
<p>&#8220;A furriner come ter town yistidday, an&#8217; sot out
straightway acrost Hemlock Mountain fer old Cappeze&#8217;s
dwellin&#8217; house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What manner of man war he, Joe?&#8221; Sim&#8217;s interest
was perfunctory. Had he been haled into the
grand-jury room in those earlier days, the prospect
would have bristled with apprehensions, but now he
had behind him the background of respectability and
Mose Biggerstaff, who alone knew of his craven behavior
as a member of the posse, was dead. Sim felt
secure in his mantle of virtue.</p>
<p>&#8220;He war a right upstandin&#8217; sort of feller&mdash;ther furriner,&#8221;
enlightened the deputy. &#8220;He goes under ther
name of Spurrier&mdash;John Spurrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>As though an electric wire of high tension had
broken and brushed him in falling, Sim Colby&#8217;s attitude
stiffened and every muscle grew taut from neck
to ankles as his jaw sagged.</p>
<p>The deputy, with his foot already in the stirrup,
missed the terror spasms of the face gone suddenly
putty gray. He missed the gasp that contracted the
throat and caused its breath to wheeze, and when he
glanced back again from his saddle, the other had,
with an effort of sheer desperation, regained his outward
semblance of composure. He still leaned indolently
against the door frame, but now he needed
its support, because all his nerves jumped and a confusion
like the swarming of angry bees filled his brain.</p>
<p>Afterward he groped his way inside and dropped
down into a low chair by the hearth. For a long time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
he sat there breathing <a name='TC_1'></a><ins title='Was sterterously'>stertorously</ins> while the untended
fire died away to ashen dreariness. The sun went
down beyond the pine tops and still he sat dully with
his hands hanging over his knees, their fingers twitching
in panic aimlessness.</p>
<p>Out of a past that he had cut away from the present
had arisen a ghost of hideous menace. Here into the
laurel which had promised sanctuary his Nemesis had
pursued him.</p>
<p>Two men with the guilt of a murder standing between
them had come into a radius too small to contain
them both. It was as if they had met on a narrow
log spanning a chasm where only one could pass and
the other must fall.</p>
<p>If old Cappeze dragged him to the courthouse now,
he would be delivered over to Spurrier, waiting there
to identify him, as a fox in a trap is delivered to the
skinning knife. That must be the meaning of the
stranger&#8217;s visit to the lawyer.</p>
<p>Sim Colby went to an ancient and dilapidated
bureau and from a creaking drawer took out a memento
which, for some reason, he had preserved from
times not treasured in memory. He carried it to the
open door and stood looking at it as it lay on the palm
of his hand with the light glinting upon it.</p>
<p>It was a sharpshooter&#8217;s medal, for, whatever his
military shortcomings, Private Grant had been an efficient
rifleman, and as he looked at it now his lips
twisted into a grim smile. Then he took his rifle from
its corner and, sitting on the doorstep, polished it with
a fond particularity, oiling its mechanism and burnishing
its bore.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>Already Spurrier had made arrangements to ensconce
himself under the roof of a house he had
rented. Already the faces that he met in the road
were, for the most part, familiar, and without exception
they were friendly. Quick on the heels of his
first disgust for the squalor of this lapsed and retarded
life, had succeeded an exhilaration born of the wine-like
sparkle of the air and the majestic breadth of
vistas across ridge and valley. As he watched mile-wide
shadows creep between sky-high lines of peaks,
his dreams borrowed something of their vastness.</p>
<p>Through half-closed lids imagination looked out
until the range-broken spaces altered to its vision.
Spurrier saw white roads and the glitter of rails running
off into gossamer webs of distance. Where now
stood virgin forests of hard wood he visualized the
shaftings of oil derricks, the red iron sheeting of
tanks, the belching stacks of refineries, and in that defaced
landscape he read the triumph of conquest; the
guerdon of wealth; the satisfaction of power.</p>
<p>One afternoon Spurrier started over to the house
he had rented, but into which he had not yet moved.
The way lay for a furlong or more through a gorge
deeply and somberly shaded. Even now, at midday,
the sunlight of the upper places left it cloistered and
the bowlders trooped along in ferny dampness, where
the little waters whispered.</p>
<p>Beside a bulky hummock of green-corroded sandstone
the man halted and stood musingly, with eyes
downcast and thoughts uplifted&mdash;uplifted to the worship
of his one god: Ambition. At his feet was an
oily sediment along the water&#8217;s edge and the gravel
was thick with &#8220;sand blossom&#8221;&mdash;tiny fossil formations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
that are prima facie evidence of oil. Then,
without warning, he felt a light sting along his cheek
and the rock-walled fissure reverberated under what
seemed a volley of musketry.</p>
<p>But the magnified and crumbling effect of the echo
struck him with a less poignant realization than a
slighter sound and a sharper one. As if a taut piano
wire had been sharply struck, came the clear whang
that he recognized as the flight song of a rifle bullet,
and, whatever its origin it called for a prompt taking
of cover.</p>
<p>Spurrier side-stepped as quickly as a boxer, and
stood, for the moment at least, bulwarked behind the
rock that was so providentially close.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m John Spurrier&mdash;a stranger in these parts,&#8221;
he sung out in a confident voice of forced boldness
and cheerfulness. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve made a mistake
in your man.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer and Spurrier cautiously raised
his hat on the end of a stick with the same deliberation
that might have marked his action had it been his own
head emerging from cover.</p>
<p>Instantly the hidden rifle spoke again and the hat
came down pierced through its band, while the rocks
once more reverberated to multiplied detonations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would seem,&#8221; the man told himself grimly, &#8220;that
after all there was no mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was unarmed and in no position to pursue investigations
of the mystery, but by crawling along on
his belly he could keep his body shielded behind the
litter of broken stone that edged the brook until he
reached the end of the gorge itself and came to safer
territory.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>Slowly, Spurrier traveled out of his precarious position,
flattening himself when he paused to rest and
listen, as he had made his men flatten themselves over
there in the islands when they were going forward
without cover under the fire of snipers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Spurrier was not frightened, but he was
deeply mystified, and when he reached the cabin
which he was preparing for occupancy he sat
down on the old millstone that served as a doorstep
and sought enlightenment from reflection and the
companionship of an ancient pipe.</p>
<p>In an hour or two &#8220;Uncle Jimmy&#8221; Litchfield, under
whose smoky roof he was being temporarily sheltered,
would arrive with a jolt wagon and yoke of oxen,
teaming over the household goods that Spurrier meant
to install. Already the new tenant had swept and
whitewashed his cabin interior and had let the clear
winds rake away the mildew of its long vacancy. Now
he sat smoking with a perplexity-drawn brow, while
a tuneful sky seemed to laugh mockingly at the absurd
idea of riflemen in ambush.</p>
<p>Every neighbor had manifested a spirit of cordiality
toward him. To many of them he was indebted for
small and voluntary kindnesses, and he had maintained
a diplomatic neutrality in all local affairs that
bore a controversial aspect.</p>
<p>Certainly, he could not flatter himself that as yet
any premonition of danger had percolated to those distant
centers of industry against which he was devising
a campaign of surprise. One explanation only
presented itself with any color of <a name='TC_2'></a><ins title='Was plausiblity'>plausibility</ins>.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>That trickle of water might come to the gorge from
a spot back in the laurel where, under the shelter of
a felled hemlock top, some one tended a small &#8220;blockade&#8221;
distillery; some one who resented an invasion of
his privacy.</p>
<p>Yet even that inference was not satisfactory. Only
yesterday a man had offered him moonshine whisky,
declaring quite unsuspiciously: &#8220;Ef ye&#8217;re vouched fer
by Uncle Jimmy, I ain&#8217;t a&#8217;skeered of ye none. I
made thet licker myself&mdash;drink hearty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the real truth no ghostly glimmer of suspicion
came in even the most shadowy fashion to his mind.</p>
<p>His efforts to trace to definite result some filament
of fact that might prove the court-martial to have
reached a conclusion at variance with the truth, had
all ended in failure. That the matter was hopeless
was an admission which he could not afford to make
and which he doggedly denied, but with waning confidence.</p>
<p>This state of mind prevented him from suspecting
any connection between this present and mysterious
enmity and those things which had happened across
the Pacific.</p>
<p>He had kept himself informed as to the movements
of Private Severance and when that time-expired man
had stepped ashore at San Francisco, John Spurrier
had been waiting to confront him, even though it involved
facing men who had once been brother officers
and who could no longer speak to him as an equal.</p>
<p>From the former soldier, who brought a flush to
his cheeks by saluting him and calling him &#8220;Lieutenant,&#8221;
he had learned nothing. There had been no
reason to hope for much. It was unlikely that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
would be able to shake into a damaging admission of
complicity&mdash;and any statement of value must have
amounted to that&mdash;the witness who had come unscathed
out of the cross-examination of two courts-martial.</p>
<p>Indeed Spurrier had expected to encounter unveiled
hostility in the attitude of the mountaineer, who had
been doing sentry duty at the door through which
the prisoner, Grant, had escaped. It might have followed
logically upon the officer&#8217;s defense, which had
sought to involve that sentinel as an accomplice in
the fugitive&#8217;s flight, and even in the murder itself.</p>
<p>But Severance had greeted him without rancor and
with the disarming guise of candid friendliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be full willin&#8217; ter help ye, Lieutenant&mdash;ef so be
I could,&#8221; he had protested. &#8220;I knows full well yore
lawyers was plum obliged ter seek ter hang ther blame
wharsoever they was able, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t harborin&#8217; no
grudge because I happened ter be one they sought ter
hurt. But I don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; that kin aid ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think Grant escaped alive?&#8221; demanded
Spurrier, and the other shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feels so plum, dead sartain he died,&#8221; came the
prompt response, &#8220;thet when I gits back home I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; ter tell his folks he did. Bud Grant was a friend
of mine, but when he went out inter thet jungle he
was too weakly ter keer fer hisself an&#8217; ef he&#8217;d lived
they would hev done found him an&#8217; brought him
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier had come to embrace that belief himself.
The one man whose admission, wrung from him by
persuasion or compulsion, could give him back his
clean name, must have perished there in the <i>bijuca</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
tangles. The hope of meeting the runaway in life
had died in the ex-officer&#8217;s heart and consequently it
did not now occur to him to think of the deserter as a
living menace.</p>
<p>At length he rose and stood against the shadowy
background of his door, which was an oblong of darkness
behind the golden outer clarity.</p>
<p>Off in the tangle of oak and poplar and pine a ruffed
grouse drummed and a &#8220;cock of the woods&#8221; rapped its
tattoo on a sycamore top.</p>
<p>Once he fancied he heard a stirring in the rhododendron
where its large waxen leaves banked themselves
thickly a hundred yards distant, and his eyes
turned that way seeking to pierce the impenetrable
screen&mdash;but unavailingly. Perhaps some small, wild
thing had moved there.</p>
<p>Then, as had happened before that afternoon,
the stillness broke to a rifle shot&mdash;this time clean and
sharp, unclogged by echoes.</p>
<p>Spurrier stood for an instant while a surprised expression
showed in his out-staring eyes, then he
swayed on his feet. His hands came up and clutched
spasmodically at his left breast, and with a sudden
collapse he dropped heavily backward, and lay full
length, swallowed in the darkness that hung beyond
the door.</p>
<p>Over the rhododendron thicket quiet settled
drowsily again, but through the toughness of interlaced
branches stole upward and outward an acrid
powder smell and a barely perceptible trickle of smoke.</p>
<p>Crouched there, his neutral-hued clothing merging
into the earth tones about him, a man peered out, but
he did not rise to go forward and inspect his work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Instead, he opened the breech block of his piece and
with unhurried care blew through the barrel&mdash;cleansing
it of its vapors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon thar ain&#8217;t no needcessity to go over thar
an&#8217; look at him,&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;When they draps
down <i>thet</i>-away, they don&#8217;t git up no more&mdash;an&#8217; some
person from afar mout spy me crossin&#8217; ther dooryard.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he edged backward into the tangle, moving like
a crawfish and noiselessly took up his homeward
journey.</p>
<p>When the slow plodding ox team came at last to
the dooryard and Uncle Billy stood shouting outside
the house, Sim Colby, holding to tangles where he
would meet no chance wayfarer, was already miles
away and hurrying to establish his alibi against suspicion,
in his own neighborhood&mdash;where no one knew
he had been absent.</p>
<p>Though it be an evil thing and shameful to confess,
ex-private Bud Grant, alias Sim Colby, traveled
light-heartedly, roweled by no tortures of conscience,
but blithe in the assurance of a ghost laid, and a
peril averted.</p>
<p>He would have been both amazed and chagrined
had he remained peering from his ambuscade, for
when Uncle Billy&#8217;s shadow fell through the open door
the man to whom he had come rose from a chair to
meet him, and he presented no mangled or blood-stained
breast to the eyes of his visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye ain&#8217;t jest a-quippin&#8217; with me, be ye?&#8221; demanded
the old mountaineer incredulously when he had heard
the story in all its detail. &#8220;This hyar&#8217;s a right serious-soundin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
matter&mdash;an&#8217; ye ain&#8217;t got no enemies
amongst us thet I&#8217;ve heered tell of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier pointed out the spot in the newly whitewashed
wall where the bullet lay imbedded with its
glint of freshly flattened lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the first experience,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I&#8217;d had
some time to think. I was standing in the door so I
fell down&mdash;and played dead.&#8221; He added after a pause
quietly: &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen men shot to death, and I happened
to know how a man drops when it&#8217;s a heart hit.
I fell inside where I&#8217;d be out of sight, because I was
unarmed, and all I could do was to wait for you. I
watched through the door, but the fellow never
showed himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; commanded the old mountaineer
in a determined voice. &#8220;Let&#8217;s beat thet la&#8217;rel while
ther tracks is still fresh. Mebby we mout l&#8217;arn somethin&#8217;
of this hyar monstrous matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they learned nothing. Sim Colby had spent
painstaking thought upon his effort and he had left
no evidence written in the mold of the forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit beats all hell,&#8221; declared the nonplussed Uncle
Billy at last. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got ther power ter fathom hit.
Ef I war you I wouldn&#8217;t talk erbout this ter no man
save only me an&#8217; old Dyke Cappeze. Still-huntin&#8217;
lands more game then blowin&#8217; a fox horn.&#8221; And
Spurrier nodded his head.</p>
<p>Though Spurrier for a few days after that slipped
through the gorge with the stealth of a sharpshooter,
covering himself behind rocks as he went, he heard
no sound there more alarming than the chatter of
squirrels or the grunt of a strayed razor-back rooting
among the acorns. Gradually he relaxed his vigilance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
as a man will if his nature is bold and his dreams
too sweeping to be forever hobbled by petty precautions.</p>
<p>The purpose which he privately served called for
ranging the country with a trained eye, and with him
went the contour maps upon which were traced red
lines.</p>
<p>One day he came, somewhat winded from a stiff
climb, to an eminence that spread the earth below him
and made of it a panorama. The bright carnival of
the autumn was spending itself to its end, but among
trees already naked stood others that clung to a gorgeousness
of color the more brilliant in the face of
death. Overhead was flawless blue, and there was a
dreamy violet where it merged <a name='TC_3'></a><ins title='Was mistly'>mistily</ins> with the skyline
ridges.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that it needs,&#8221; mused the man whimsically and
aloud, &#8220;is the music of Pan&#8217;s pipes&mdash;and perhaps a
small chorus of dryads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he heard a laugh and, wheeling suddenly, discovered
Glory Cappeze regarding him from the cap
of a towering rock where, until he had reached this
level, she had been hidden from view. Now she
flushed shyly as the man strode over and confronted
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you still hate me?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon thet don&#8217;t make no master differ ter ye,
does hit?&#8221; The musical voice was painfully diffident,
and he remembered that she had always been shy with
him except on that first meeting when the leaping
anger in her eyes had burned away self-consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he gravely reminded her, &#8220;when I
first saw you, you were on the point of thrashing me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
You had me cowed and timid. Since then I&#8217;ve come
to think of you as the shooting star.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, waiting for her to demand an elucidation
of that somewhat obscure statement, but she said
nothing. She only sat gazing over his head toward
the horizon, and her cheeks were excitedly flushed
from the delicate pink of apple bloom to the warmer
color of peach blossom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you don&#8217;t ask what I mean,&#8221; he continued
easily, &#8220;I shall tell you. I&#8217;ve been to your house perhaps
four or five times. From afar, each time, I&#8217;ve
seen a scrap of color. Sometimes it has been blue,
sometimes red, but always it has vanished with the
swiftness of a shooting star. It is a flash and it is
gone. Sometimes from beyond a door I also hear a
voice singing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned his elbows on the rock at her feet and
stood gazing into the eyes that would not meet his
own, and still she favored him with no response.
After a little silence the man altered his tone and
spoke argumentatively:</p>
<p>&#8220;You forgave the dog, you know&mdash;why not the
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>That question carried her thoughts back to the murdered
quail and a gusty back-flash of resentment conquered
her diffidence. Her sternness of tone and the
thrushlike softness of her voice, mingled with the
piquancy of paradox.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dawg don&#8217;t know no better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some dogs are very wise,&#8221; he assured her. &#8220;And
some men very foolish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dawg,&#8221; she went on still unplacated, &#8220;got
right down on his stomach and asked my pardon. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
<i>hed</i> ter fergive him, when he humbled hisself like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; John Spurrier amiably assured her,
&#8220;to get right down on my stomach, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she laughed, and though she sought to retreat
again into her aloofness, the spell was broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I forgiven?&#8221; he demanded, and she shook
her head doubtfully though no longer with conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she told him; then she added with a startlingly
exact mimicry of her father&#8217;s most legalistic
manner: &#8220;No. The co&#8217;te will take the case under
advisement an&#8217; defer jedgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you are a lawyer&#8217;s daughter.
What were you looking at across there&mdash;so fascinatedly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them hills,&#8221; she enlightened succinctly.</p>
<p>Spurrier studied her. Her deep eyes had held a
glow of almost prayerful enchantment for which her
laconic words seemed inadequate.</p>
<p>Watching her out of the tail of his eye he fell into
borrowed phrases: &#8220;&#8216;Violet peaks uplifted through
the crystal evening air.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She shot a glance at him suddenly, eagerly; then at
once the lids lowered, masking the eyes again as she
inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet thar&#8217;s poetry, ain&#8217;t hit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m prepared to go to the mat with any critic who
holds the contrary,&#8221; he assured her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s comin&#8217; on ter be night. I&#8217;ve got ter start
home,&#8221; she irrelevantly announced, as she slid from
her rough throne, and the man fell boldly in step at
her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;When your honor rules on the matter under advisement,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
he said humbly before their paths separated,
&#8220;please remember that the defendant was a
poor wretch who didn&#8217;t know he was breaking the
law.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time their glances engaged fully and
without avoidance, and a twinkle flashed in the girl&#8217;s
pupils.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ignorantia legis neminem excusat</i>,&#8221; she serenely
responded, and Spurrier gasped. Here was a girl who
could not steer her English around the shoals of illiteracy,
giving him his retort in Latin: &#8220;Ignorance of
the law excuses no one.&#8221; Of course, it meant only
that her quick memory had appropriated and was
parroting legal phrases learned from her father, but it
struck the chord of contrasts, and to the man&#8217;s imagination
it dramatized her so that when she had gone
on with the lissome grace of her light stride, he stood
looking after her.</p>
<p>Rather abruptly after that the autumn fires of
splendor burned out to the ashes of coming winter,
and then it was that Spurrier went north. As his
train carried him seaward he had the feeling that it
was also transporting him from an older to a younger
century, and that while his mind dwelt on the stalwart
and unsophisticated folk with whom he had been
brushing shoulders, the life resolved itself into an
austere picture against which the image of Glory stood
out with the quick vividness of a red cardinal flitting
among somber pine branches.</p>
<p>Because she was so far removed from his own orbit
he could think of her impersonally and enjoy the
thought as though it were of a new type of flower or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
bird, recognizing her attractive qualities in a detached
fashion.</p>
<p>As Spurrier gave himself up to the relaxation of
reminiscence with that abandon of train travel which
admits of no sustained effort, he began comparing this
life, left over from another era, with that he had
known against more cultivated and complex backgrounds.</p>
<p>Then in analytical mood he reviewed his own past,
looking with a lengthening of perspective on the love
affair that had been broken by his court-martial. His
adoration of the Beverly girl had been youthful
enough to surround itself with young illusions.</p>
<p>That was why it had all hurt so bitterly, perhaps,
with its ripping away of his faith in romantic conceptions
of love-loyalty.</p>
<p>He wondered now if he had not borne himself with
the Quixotic martyrdom of callowness. He had
sought to shield the girl from even the realization that
her lack of confidence was ungenerous. He had
sought to take all the pain and spare her from sharing
it. But she had solaced herself with a swift recovery
and a new lover, and had he been guilty she
could not have abandoned him more cavalierly. Well,
that softness belonged to an out-grown stage of development.</p>
<p>He had seen himself then as obeying the dictates
of chivalry. He thought of it now as inexperienced
folly&mdash;perhaps, so far as she was concerned, as a lucky
escape. His amours of the present were not so
naively conducted. To Vivian he had paid his attentions
with an eye watchful of material advantages.
They belonged to a sophisticated circle which seasoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
life&#8217;s fare rather with the salt of cynicism than
with the sugar of romanticism. Yet the thought of
Vivian caused no pulse to flutter excitedly.</p>
<p>The glimpse of Glory had been refreshing because
she was so honest and sincere that she disquieted
one&#8217;s acquired cynicism of viewpoint. One might as
well spout world-wisdom to a lilac bush as to Glory!
Yet there was a sureness about her which argued for
her creed of wholesome, simple things and old half-forgotten
faiths which one would like to keep alive&mdash;if
one could.</p>
<p>Snow drifted in the air and made a nimbus about
each arc light as Spurrier&#8217;s taxi, turning between the
collonade pillars of the Pennsylvania Station, gave
him his first returning glimpse of New York. He had
come East in obedience to a wired summons from
Martin Harrison, brief to curtness as were all business
messages from that man of few and trenchant
words. The telegram had been slow crossing the
mountain, but Spurrier had been prompt in his response.</p>
<p>A tempered glare hung mistily above the Longacre
Square district through the snow flurries to the north,
and the rumbled voice of the town, after these months
in quiet places, was to the returned pilgrim like the
heavy breathing of a monster sleeping out a fever.</p>
<p>At the room that he kept at his club in Fifth Avenue&mdash;for
that was a part of the pretentious display of
affluence made necessary by his ambitious scheme of
things&mdash;he called up a number from memory. It was
a number not included in the telephone directory, and,
recognizing the voice that answered him, he said
briefly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Manners, this is Mr. Spurrier. Will you tell Mr.
Harrison I&#8217;m on the wire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Spurrier,&#8221; boomed a deep voice after an
interval. &#8220;We&#8217;re dining out this evening and we go
to the opera afterward, but I want a word with you
to-night. In fact, I want you to start for Russia on
Wednesday. Drop into our box, and drive home with
me for a few minutes afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russia on Wednesday! Spurrier&#8217;s unoccupied hand
clenched in irritation, but his voice was as unruffled
as if he had been asked to make ready for a journey
to Hoboken. He knew enough of Harrison&#8217;s methods
to ask no questions. If they could have been answered
over the phone Harrison could have found many men
to send to Russia. It was because they were for his
ear alone that he had been called to New York.</p>
<p>That evening he listened to &#8220;Otello&#8221; with thoughts
that wandered from the voices of the singers. They
refused even to be chained by the novelty of a slender
tenor as a new Russian star held the spotlight. He
was studying the almost too regular beauty of Vivian
Harrison&#8217;s profile as she sat serene and self-confident
with the horseshoe of the Metropolitan beyond her.</p>
<p>At midnight Spurrier sat with Harrison in his
study and listened to a crisp summarizing of the Russian
scheme. It proved to be a project boldly conceived
on a broad scale and requiring an ambassador
dependable enough and resourceful enough to decide
large matters as they arose, without cabling for instructions.</p>
<p>In turn Spurrier talked of his own past doings, and
through their cigar smoke the seeming idleness of
those weeks assayed a wealth of exact information
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and stood revealed as the incubation period of a large
conception. Keenly formulated plans emerged from
his recitals so simply and convincingly that the greater
financier leaned forward and let his cigar die.</p>
<p>Then Harrison rose and paced the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know something about me, Spurrier,&#8221; he
began. &#8220;When I came East they laughed at me&mdash;if
they deigned to notice me at all. They said: &#8216;Here
comes a bushleaguer who thinks he&#8217;s good enough for
the big game. It&#8217;s one more lamb to the shearing
shed.&#8217; That&#8217;s the East, Spurrier! That&#8217;s cocksure
New York! They sneer at a Western-bred horse&mdash;or
a Western-trained prize fighter&mdash;and when the
newcomer licks the best they&#8217;ve got they straightway
let out a holler that they taught him all he knows.
Why, New York would die of lassitude and anæmia if
it wasn&#8217;t for blood infusions from the provinces!&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier gazed interestedly at the tall figure of the
man with the sandy red mustache, and the snapping
eyes, who for all his impeccability of evening dress,
might have taken a shovel or pick from a section
hand and taught him how to level a road bed. Harrison
laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t inhaled me so far. I brought only
a million with me to this town, and I&#8217;ve got&mdash;well,
I&#8217;ve got plenty, but I can&#8217;t call it a day quite yet.
There&#8217;s one buccaneer to be settled with first! He&#8217;s
got to go to the mat with me and come up bloody
enough to admit that he&#8217;s been in a ruction. He
chooses to pretend that I&#8217;m nonexistent, and I won&#8217;t
stand being ignored! I want to leave my mark on
that man, and with God&#8217;s help&mdash;and yours&mdash;I&#8217;m going
to do it!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You mean Trabue?&#8221; asked Spurrier, and Harrison&#8217;s
head gave a decisive jerk of affirmation while
the hot glow of his eyes made his companion think of
smelting furnaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why this thing of yours interests me.
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m willing to get behind you and back you
to the hilt,&#8221; the big fellow of finance went on. &#8220;A.
O. and G. are trying to hold others out of this Kentucky
field. That proves that they think enough of
it to be hurt by having it torn from their teeth. All I
need to know is what will hurt them! If you can
take some teeth along with the bone, so much the better.&#8221;
He paused, then in a voice that had altered to
cold steadiness, commanded: &#8220;Now, give me your
facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At present prices of oil,&#8221; summarized Spurrier,
&#8220;the development back of Hemlock Mountain
wouldn&#8217;t pay. With higher market values, it <i>would</i>
pay, but less handsomely than other fields A. O. and
G. can work. Once the initial cost is laid out, the
profit will be constant. The A. O. and G. idea is to
hold it in reserve and await developments&mdash;meanwhile
keeping up the &#8216;no trespass&#8217; sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the range practically prohibit railroading?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly&mdash;but it doesn&#8217;t prohibit pipe lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier opened the packet he had brought in his
overcoat pocket and spread a map under the flooding
light of a table lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have traced there what seems to me a practical
piping route,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I call it the neck of
the bottle. There is a sort of gap through the hills
and a porous formation caused by a chain of caverns.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
Nature is willing to help with some ready-made tunnels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t they discovered that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The oil development of fifteen years ago never
crossed Hemlock Mountain. It came the other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrison stood thinking for a time, then demanded
tersely: &#8220;Have you secured any land or options?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not an acre, nor an inch,&#8221; laughed Spurrier.
&#8220;This is a waiting game. I don&#8217;t mean to appear interested.
If any man offered to give me a farm I
should say it wasn&#8217;t worth State taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we get the property into our hands
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The buying must be gradual and through men
with whom we appear to have no connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the State charter&mdash;how about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There lies the chief problem,&#8221; admitted Spurrier.
&#8220;The charter must come from a legislature that A. O.
and G. can, at present, control.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; Harrison shot the question out like a cross-examiner,
&#8220;is the present attitude of the natives toward
oil and oil men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indifference and skepticism.&#8221; The reply was
prompt but the amplification more deliberate. &#8220;Once
they saw wealth ahead&mdash;then the boom collapsed, and
they have no longer any faith in the magic of the word
&#8216;oil.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume,&#8221; suggested Harrison, &#8220;you are encouraging
that disbelief?&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier&#8217;s face clouded, but only for a moment.
&#8220;I am the most skeptical of all the skeptics,&#8221; he assented,
&#8220;and yet I&#8217;m sorry that they can&#8217;t be gainers.
They are an honest, upstanding folk and they have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
always felt the pinch of privation. After all they are
the rightful owners and development of their country
ought to benefit them. Of course, though, to forecast
the possibilities would kill the game. We can&#8217;t
take them into our confidence without sounding a
warning to the enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing sentimental?&#8221; queried Harrison dryly,
and the younger man shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he responded slowly, &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford that&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And see that you don&#8217;t,&#8221; admonished the chief
sharply. &#8220;Bear in mind, as you have in the past, that
we don&#8217;t want to depend on men of brittle resolution
and temperamental squeamishness. We are in this
thing toward a definite end and not as humanitarian
dreamers. However&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He broke off abruptly
and added in a milder voice, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to caution
you. You understand the proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some minutes the cigar smoke floated in a silent
room, while Martin Harrison sat with the knitted
brows of concentrated thought. Spurrier did not interrupt
the mental process which he knew had the
heat and power of an ore smelter, reducing to fluid
amenability the hard metal of a stubborn proposition.
He knew, too, that the fuel which fed the fire was his
principal&#8217;s animosity against Trabue, rather than the
possibilities or extent of the loot. This, no less than
the mountain vendetta, was, in last analysis, a personal
feud and in the parlance of the Cumberlands a
&#8220;war was in ther b&#8217;ilin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last Harrison straightened up and tossed away
his cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are ambitious, Spurrier,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Put this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
thing over and I should say that all your ambitions
can come to realization.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he sat waiting Spurrier had lifted from the
table a photograph of Vivien, appropriately framed in
silver. He had taken it up idly because it was a new
portrait and one that he had not before seen, but into
the gesture the father read a deeper significance. It
was as if Spurrier had asked &#8220;All my ambitions?&#8221;
and had emphasized his question by laying his hands
on the picture of the girl. That, thought Harrison,
was an audacious suggestion, but it was Spurrier&#8217;s
audacity that recommended him.</p>
<p>Slowly the capitalist&#8217;s eyes lighted into an amused
smile as their glance traveled from the younger face
to the framed photograph, and slowly he nodded his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>All</i> your ambitions,&#8221; he repeated meaningly, then
with the electric snap of warning in his voice he added
an admonition: &#8220;But don&#8217;t underestimate the difficulties
of your undertaking. You are bucking the
strongest and most relentless piracy in finance. You
will incur enmities that will stop nowhere, and you
must operate in a country where murderers are for
&#8216;hire.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The threat of personal danger just at that moment
disquieted John Spurrier less than the other curtailment
of freedom implied in Harrison&#8217;s words; the
tacit acceptance of him as Vivien&#8217;s suitor. It came
to him abruptly that he did not love Vivien; that he
wished to remain untrammeled. Heretofore, he had
always postponed matrimonial thoughts for the misty
future. Now they became embarrassingly near and
tangible.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>But quick on this realization followed another.
Here was an offered alliance of tremendous advantage
and one not to be ignored. To be Vivien&#8217;s husband
might fail of rapture, but to be Martin Harrison&#8217;s
son-in-law meant triumph. It meant his own nomination
as heir apparent and successor in that position
of cardinal importance to which he had looked upward
as to a throne.</p>
<p>There was no trace of dubiety in his voice as he
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have counted the handicaps, sir. I&#8217;m taking my
chance with open eyes.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>Sim Colby, after that day when he had slipped
through the laurel, had gone back to his own
house and waited for the talk of John Spurrier&#8217;s
mysterious death to drift along the waterways where
news is the only speedy traveler.</p>
<p>There had been no such gossip and he had dared
betray his interest by no inquiry, but he knew it could
have only one meaning; that he had failed.</p>
<p>Spurrier was alive, and obviously he was holding
his counsel concerning his narrow escape. This silence
seemed to Sim Colby an ominous thing indicative of
some crafty purpose&mdash;as if the intended victim were
stalking grimly as well as being stalked. Sim came
of a race that knows how to bide its time and that can
keep bright the edge of hatred against long-delayed
reprisals. It was certainly to be presumed that Spurrier
had taken some of his friends into his confidence
and that under the mantle of silence over on Little
Turkey Tail, these friends were now watchfully alert.
The enterprise that had once failed could not be reundertaken
at once. Sim must wait for the vigilance
to &#8220;blow over,&#8221; and while he waited the rancor of
his hatred must fester with the thorn-prickings of a
thousand doubts and apprehensions.</p>
<p>Then he heard one day that Spurrier had left the
mountains, and on another day the news was brought
that the grand jury had declined to reopen the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
issues of the murder case in which Mosebury had
escaped justice. Both these things were comforting in
themselves, but they failed of complete reassurance
for the deserter.</p>
<p>Men said that Spurrier was coming back again, so
the day of reckoning was only deferred&mdash;not escaped.</p>
<p>The determination with which Sim had set out on
his mission of death had largely preëmpted his field of
thought. Now, after weeks and months of brooding
reflection, he himself had become only a sort of human
garment worn by the sinister spirit of resolve.</p>
<p>So all that winter while John Spurrier was away
as the ambassador, practicing in Moscow and Odessa
the adroit arts of financial diplomacy, the fixed idea
of his assassination was festering in the mind of the
man who lived, under an assumed name, at the head
of Little Quicksand.</p>
<p>That obsession took fantastic shapes and wove
webs of grotesque patterns of hate as Colby, who had
been Grant, sat brooding before his untidy hearth
while the winter winds wailed about the eaves and
lashed the mountain world into forlorn bleakness.</p>
<p>And while Colby meditated unendingly on the absentee
and built ugly plans against his return, so in
another house and in another spirit, the ex-officer was
also remembered.</p>
<p>Winter in these well-nigh roadless hills meant a
blockade and a siege with loneliness and stagnation
as the impregnably intrenched attackers. The victims
could only wait and endure until the rescue
forces of spring should come to raise the chill and
sodden barricade, with a flaunting of blossom-banners
and the whispered song of warm victory.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>Glory Cappeze, for the first time in her life, suffered
from loneliness. She had thought herself too
used to it to mind it much, but John Spurrier had
brought a new element to her existence and left behind
him a void. She had been hardly more than
an onlooker to his occasional visits with her father,
but she had been a very interested onlooker. When
he talked a vigorous mind had spoken and had
brought the greater, unknown, outer world to her
door. The striking face with its square jaw; the ingrained
graces and courtesies of his bearing; the
quickness of his understanding&mdash;all these things had
been a light in the gray mediocrity of uneventful
days and a flame that had fired her imagination to a
splendid disquiet.</p>
<p>The infectious smile and force of personality that
had been a challenge to more critical women, had
been almost dazzling qualities to the mountain girl of
strangled opportunities.</p>
<p>But it was that last meeting in which he had
thawed her shyness into friendliness that Glory remembered
most eagerly. That had seemed to make
of Spurrier not only a hero admired from a distance
but a hero who was also a friend, and she was hungry
for friends.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that to these two widely variant
welcomes, neither of which he suspected, John Spurrier
was returning from Russia when spring had
lightly brushed the Cumberland slopes with delicate
fragrance and the color of blossoming.</p>
<p>In Louisville, in Frankfort, and in other Kentucky
towns along his way the returning man had made
stops and investigations, to the end that he came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
primed with certain information of an ex-cathedra
sort.</p>
<p>The fruits of this research included an abstract of
the personnel of the legislature and the trend of oil
influences in State politics, and he studied his notebook
as he traveled from the rolling, almost voluptuous
fertility of the bluegrass section to the piedmont
where the foothills began to break the sky.</p>
<p>On the porch of the dilapidated hotel at Waterfall
a sparse crowd centered about a seated figure, and
when he had reached the spot Spurrier paused, challenged
by a sense of the medieval, that gripped him as
tangibly as a hand clapped upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>The seated man was blind and shabby, with a beggar&#8217;s
cup strapped to his knee, and a &#8220;fiddle&#8221; nestling
close to the stubbled chin of a disfigured face. He
sang in a weird falsetto, with minors that rose thin
and dolorous, but he was in every essential the ballad
singer who improvised his lays upon topical themes,
as did Scott&#8217;s last minstrel&mdash;a survival of antiquity.</p>
<p>Now he was whining out a personal plaint in the
words of his &#8220;song ballet.&#8221;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;I used ter hev ther sight ter see ther hills so high an&#8217; green,</p>
<p>I used ter work a standard rig an&#8217; drill fer kero<i>sene</i>.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The singer&#8217;s lugubrious pathos appeared to be received
with attentive and uncritical interest. Beyond
doubt he took himself seriously and sadly.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;I used ter know a woman&#8217;s love, an&#8217; read a woman&#8217;s eyes,</p>
<p>An&#8217; look into my baby&#8217;s face an&#8217; dwell in paradise,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>Until a comp&#8217;ny foreman, plum&#8217; heedless in his mind</p>
<p>Let nitroglycer<i>een</i> explode an&#8217; made me go stone blind.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Spurrier, half-turning, saw a traveling salesman
standing at his elbow with a repressed grin of amusement
struggling in his glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer card, that,&#8221; whispered the drummer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
seen him before; one of the wrecks left over from the
oil-boom days. A &#8216;go-devil&#8217; let loose too soon and
blinded him.&#8221; He paused, then added as though by
way of apology for his seeming callousness: &#8220;Some
people say the old boy is a sort of a miser and has a
snug pile salted away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier nodded and went on into the office, but
later in the day he sought out the blind fiddler and engaged
him in conversation. The man&#8217;s blinding had
left him a legacy of hate for all oil operators, and
from such relics as this of the active days Spurrier
knew how to evoke scraps of available information.
It was not until later that it occurred to him that he
had answered questions as well as asked them&mdash;but,
of course, he had not been indiscreet.</p>
<p>With John Spurrier, riding across hills afoam with
dogwood blossom and tenderly vivid with young
green, went persistently the thought of the blind beggar
who seemed almost epic in his symbolism of
human wreckage adrift in the wake of the boom. Yet
he was honest enough to admit inwardly that should
victory fall to his banners there would be flotsam in
the wake of his triumph, too; simple folk despoiled
of their birthright. He came as no altruist to fight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
for the native born. He, no less than A. O. and G.,
sought to exploit them.</p>
<p>When he went to the house of Dyke Cappeze he did
not admit the curiosity, amounting to positive anxiety,
to see again the little barbarian, who slurred consonants,
doubled her negatives, split her infinitives and
retorted in the Latin of Blackstone. Yet when Glory
did not at once appear, he found himself unaccountably
disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been another stranger in here since you
went away,&#8221; the old man smilingly told him. &#8220;What
is he doing here? That&#8217;s the one burning question
debated along the highways when men &#8216;meet and make
their manners.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; laughed Spurrier, &#8220;what <i>is</i> he doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cappeze shrugged his bent shoulders as he knocked
the rubble from his pipe and a quizzical twinkle came
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I can make out, sir, he&#8217;s as much a
gentleman of leisure as you are yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier knew what an excellent subterfuge may
sometimes lie in frankness, and now he had recourse
to its concealment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Mr. Cappeze, I&#8217;m no idler!&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;m associated with capitalists who work me
like a mule. Since I saw you, for example, I&#8217;ve been
in Russia and I&#8217;ve been hard-driven. That&#8217;s why I
come here. If I couldn&#8217;t get absolutely away from it
all now and then, I&#8217;d soon be ready for a madhouse.
Here I can forget all that and keep fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cappeze nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s just about the way I
sized you up. At first, folks pondered about you, too,
but now they take you on faith.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I hope so&mdash;and this new man? Has he stepped on
anybody&#8217;s toes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. He hasn&#8217;t even bought any land, but
there have been some several transfers of property,
in other names, since he came. He <i>may</i> be some man&#8217;s
silent partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of partnership would it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows.&#8221; For an instant the shrewd eyes
leaped into a glint of feeling. &#8220;These poor benighted
devils suspect the Greeks bearing gifts. Civilization
has always come here only to leave its scar. They have
been stung once&mdash;over oil. God pity the man who
seeks to sting them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think,&#8221; Spurrier responded lightly, as one
without personal interest, &#8220;they wouldn&#8217;t take it
kindly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once again the sonorous and kindly voice mounted
abruptly to vehemence.</p>
<p>&#8220;As kindly, sir, as a wolf bitch robbed, the second
time, of her whelps. It&#8217;s all a wolf bitch has.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening as he walked slowly homeward with
a neighbor whom he had met by the way, Spurrier
came face to face with Wharton, the other stranger,
and the mountaineer performed the offices of introduction.</p>
<p>The two men from the outer world eyed each other
incuriously and parted after an exchange of commonplaces.</p>
<p>When Spurrier separated from his chance companion,
the hillsman drawled: &#8220;Folks <i>says</i> thet feller&#8217;s
buyin&#8217; land. God knows what fer he wants hit, but ef
he <i>does</i> hone fer hit, hit&#8217;s kinderly probable thet hit&#8217;s
wuth holdin&#8217; on to.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>When the brook trout began to leap and flash Cappeze
delegated Glory to act for him as Spurrier&#8217;s
guide, and as the girl led the way to the likeliest pools,
the young, straight-growing trees were not more
gracefully slender.</p>
<p>The fragrance from the pink-hearted laurel and the
locust bloom had no delicacy more subtle or provocative
than that of her cheeks and hair. The breeze in
the nodding poplar tops seemed scarcely freer or
lighter than her movements. Like the season she was
young and in blossom and like the hills she was wild
of beauty.</p>
<p>Spurrier admitted to himself that, were he free to
respond to the pagan and vital promptings of impulse,
instead of standing pledged to rigid and austere
purposes, this girl would have made something ring
within him as a tuning fork rings to its note.</p>
<p>Since the days of Augusta Beverly&#8217;s ascendency,
he had never felt the need of raising any sort of defense
between himself and a woman. At first he had
believed himself, with youthful resentment, a woman-hater
and more latterly he had become in this, as in
other affairs, an expedientist. Augusta had proven
weak in loyalty, under stress, and Vivian had been
indifferent to the ostracism of his former comrades so
long as her own aristocracy of money accepted him.
Both had been snobs in a sense, and in a sense he too
was a snob.</p>
<p>But because this girl was of a simplicity that regarded
all things in their primary colors and nothing
in the shaded half-tones of politer usage, it was needful
to guard against her mistaking his proffered comradeship
for the attitude of the lover&mdash;and that would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
have been most disastrous. It would have made necessary
awkward explanations that would wound her,
embarrass him and arouse the old man&#8217;s just ire. For
people, he was learning, may be elementally uncouth
and yet prouder than Lucifer, and except when he
was here on their own ground there was no common
meeting place between their standards of living.</p>
<p>Yet Glory&#8217;s presence was like a gypsy-song to his
senses; rich and lyrical with a touch of the plaintive.
Glory, he knew, would have believed in him when
Augusta Beverly had doubted, and would have stood
fast when Augusta had cut loose.</p>
<p>This was the sort of thought with which it was
dangerous to dally&mdash;and perhaps that was precisely
why, under this tuneful sky, it pleased him to humor
it. Certainly, whatever the cause, the sight of her
made him step more elastically as she went on ahead.</p>
<p>When they had whipped the streams for trout until
hunger clamored, Spurrier sat, with a sandwich in his
hand in grass that waved knee-high, and through half
closed lids watched Glory as she moved about crooning
an old ballad, and seemingly unconscious of himself,
herself and all but the sunlit spirit of the early
summer day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory,&#8221; he said suddenly, calling her by her given
name for the first time and in a mood of experiment.</p>
<p>As naturally as though she had not noted his lapsed
formality, she turned toward him and answered in
kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;What air hit, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What fer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For calling me Jack.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>Then her cheeks colored deeply and she wheeled to
her work again. But after a little she faced him once
more to say half angrily:</p>
<p>&#8220;I called ye Jack because ye called me Glory.
You&#8217;ve always put a Miss afore hit till now, an&#8217; I
&#8217;lowed ye&#8217;d done made up yore mind ter be friendly
at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to be friendly,&#8221; he assured her.
&#8220;It was you who began with a hickory switch and
went on with hard words in Latin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl laughed, and the peal of her mirth transmuted
their status and dispelled her self-consciousness.
She came over and stood looking down at him
with violet eyes mischievously a-sparkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;The co&#8217;te,&#8221; she announced, &#8220;hes carefully weighed
there evidence in ther case of Jack Spurrier, charged
with ther willful murder of Bob White, and is ready
to enter jedgment. Jack Spurrier, stand up ter be
sentenced!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man rose to his feet and stood with such well-feigned
abjectness of suspense that she had to fight
back the laughter from her eyes to preserve her own
pose of judicial gravity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well established by the evidence befo&#8217; <a name='TC_4'></a><ins title='Was there'>ther</ins>
co&#8217;te,&#8221; she went solemnly on, &#8220;thet ther defendant is
guilty on every count contained in the indictment.&#8221;
She checked off upon the fingers of the left hand the
roster of his crime as she summarized it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He entered inter an unlawful conspiracy with the
codefendant Rover, a setter dawg. He made a felonious
assault without provocation. He committed murder
in the first degree with malice prepense.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>Spurrier&#8217;s head sank low in mock despair, until
Glory came to her peroration and sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet since the defendant is amply proved to be a
poor, ignorant wanderer upon the face of the earth,
unpossessed of ordinary knowledge, the court is constrained
to hold him incapable of discrimination between
right an&#8217; wrong. Hence he is not fully responsible
for his acts of violence. Mercy as well as
justice lies in the province of the law, twins of a
sacred parentage and equal before the throne.&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke off in a laugh, and so sudden was the
transition from absolute mimicry that the man forgot
to laugh with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory,&#8221; he demanded somewhat breathlessly, &#8220;have
you ever been to a theater in your life? Have you
ever seen a real actress?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you <i>are</i> one. Does this life satisfy you?
Isn&#8217;t there anything off there beyond the hills that
ever calls you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dancing eyes grew abruptly grave, almost
pained, and the response came slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Everything</i> down thar calls ter me. I craves hit
all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier suddenly recalled old Cappeze&#8217;s half-frightened
vehemence when the recluse had inveighed
against the awakening of vain longings in his daughter.
Now he changed his manner as he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I&#8217;d offend you if I put a question.
I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye mout try an&#8217; see. I ain&#8217;t got no power ter
answer twell I hears hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll risk it. Your father doesn&#8217;t talk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
mountain dialect. His English is pure&mdash;and you were
raised close to him. Why do <i>you</i> use&mdash;the other
kind?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not at once reply and, when she did, the
astonishingly adaptable creature no longer employed
vernacular, though she spoke slowly and guardedly as
one might who ventured into a foreign tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father has lived down below as well as here.
He&#8217;s a gentleman, but he aims&mdash;I mean he intends&mdash;to
live here now till he dies.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she paused Spurrier prompted her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father thinks that while I <i>do</i> live here, I&#8217;d
better fit into the life and talk in the phrases that don&#8217;t
seem high-falutin&#8217; to my neighbors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say,&#8221; he assured her with forced conviction,
&#8220;that your father is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a brief silence between them while the
warm stillness of the woods breathed its incense and
its langour, then the girl broke out <a name='TC_5'></a><ins title='Was impusively'>impulsively</ins>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see and hear and taste everything, out
there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hands swept outward with an all-embracing
gesture toward the whole of the unknown. &#8220;There
aren&#8217;t any words to tell how I want it! What do you
want more than anything else, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man remained silent for a little, studying her
under half-lowered lids while a smile hovered at the
corners of his lips. But the smile died abruptly and
it was with deep seriousness that he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, more than anything else, I want a clean
name and a vindicated reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory&#8217;s eyes widened so that their violet depths became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
pools of wondering color and her lips parted in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;A clean name!&#8221; she echoed incredulously. &#8220;What
blight have you got on it, Jack?&#8221; Then catching herself
up abruptly she flushed crimson and said apologetically:
&#8220;That&#8217;s a question I haven&#8217;t any license to
put to you, though. Only you broached the subject
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And having broached it, I am willing to pursue
it,&#8221; he assured her evenly. &#8220;I was an army officer
until I was charged with unprovoked murder&mdash;and
court-martialed; dishonorably discharged from the
service in which my father and grandfather had lived
and died.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment or two she made no answer but her
quick expressiveness of lip and eye did not, even for
a startled interval, betray any shock of horror. When
she did speak it was in a voice so soft and compassionate
that the man thought of its quality before he
realized its words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the man that&mdash;that was <i>really</i> guilty go scot
free, whilst you had to shoulder his blame?&#8221;</p>
<p>There had been no question of evidence; no waiting
for any denial of guilt. She had assumed his innocence
with the same certainty that her eye assumed
the flawlessness of the overheard blue. Her interest
was all for his wronging and not at all for his alleged
wrong.</p>
<p>The man started with surprise; the surprise of one
who had trained himself into an unnatural callousness
as a defense against what had seemed a universal
proneness to convict. He had told himself that Glory
would see with a straighter and more intuitive eye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
He had told her baldly of the thing which he seldom
mentioned out of an inquisitiveness to test her reaction
to the revelation, but he was unprepared for such
unhesitant belief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are the first human being, Glory,&#8221; he
said quietly but with unaccustomed feeling in his
voice, &#8220;who ever heard that much and gave me a
clean bill of health without hearing a good bit more.
Why didn&#8217;t you ask whether or not I was guilty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have to,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;Some men
could be murderers and some couldn&#8217;t. You couldn&#8217;t.
You might have to <i>kill</i> a man&mdash;but not murder him.
You might do lots of things that wouldn&#8217;t be right.
I don&#8217;t know about that&mdash;but those people that convicted
you were fools!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; he said soberly. &#8220;You&#8217;re right,
Glory. I was as innocent of that assassination as you
are, yet they proved me guilty. It was only through
influence that I escaped ending my days in prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he gave her the story, which he had already
told her father and no one else in the mountains. She
listened, thinking not at all of the damaging circumstances,
but secretly triumphant that she had been
chosen as a confidant.</p>
<p>But that night Spurrier looked up from a letter he
was reading and let his eyes wander to the rafters and
his thoughts to the trout stream.</p>
<p>It was a letter, too, which should have held his attention.
It contained, on a separate sheet of paper, a
list of names which was typed and headed: &#8220;Confidential
Memorandum.&#8221; Below that appeared the
notation: &#8220;Members of the general assembly, under
American Oil and Gas influence. Also names of candidates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
who oppose them at the next election, and who
may be reached by us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier lighted his pipe and his face became studious,
but presently he looked up frowning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must speak to old Cappeze,&#8221; he said aloud and
musingly. &#8220;He&#8217;s being unfair to her.&#8221; And that did
not seem a relevant comment upon the paper he held
in his hand.</p>
<p>Then Spurrier started a little as from outside a
human voice sounded above the chorus of the frogs
and whippoorwills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo,&#8221; it sung out. &#8220;Hit&#8217;s Blind Joe Givins. Kin
I come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later into the lamplight of the room
shambled the beggar of the disfigured face, whom
Spurrier had last seen at the town of Waterfall, led by
a small, brattish boy. His violin case was tightly
grasped under his arm, and his free hand was groping.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d done sot out ter visit a kinsman over at ther
head of Big Wolfpen branch,&#8221; explained the blind
man, &#8220;but ther boy hyar&#8217;s got a stone bruise on his heel
an&#8217; he kain&#8217;t handily go on, ter-night. We wonder
could we sleep hyar?&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier bowed to the law of the mountains, which
does not deny shelter to the wayfarer, but he shivered
fastidiously at the unkempt raggedness of his tramp-like
visitor, and he slipped into his pocket the papers
in his hand.</p>
<p>That night before Spurrier&#8217;s hearth, as in elder
times before the roaring logs of some feudal castle,
the wandering minstrel paid his board with song and
music; his voice rising high and tremulous in quaint
tales set to measure.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>But on the next morning the boy set out on some
mission in the neighborhood and left his charge to
await his return, seated in a low chair, and gazing
emptily ahead.</p>
<p>Spurrier went out to the road in response to the
shout of a passing neighbor, and left his papers lying
on the table top, forgetful of the presence of the sightless
guest, who sat so negligibly quiet in the chimney
corner.</p>
<p>When he entered the room again the blind man had
risen from his seat and moved across to the hearth.
On the threshold the householder halted and stood
keenly eyeing him while he groped along the mantel
shelf as if searching with wavering fingers for something
that his eyes could not discover&mdash;and the thought
of the papers which he had left exposed caused an
uneasy suspicion to dart into Spurrier&#8217;s mind. Any
eye that fell on that list would have gained the key
to his whole strategy and intent, but, of course, this
man could not see. Still Spurrier cursed himself for
a careless <a name='TC_6'></a><ins title='Removed extra quote'>fool.</ins></p>
<p>&#8220;I was jest seekin&#8217; fer a match,&#8221; said Joe Givins as
a slight sound from the other attracted his attention.
&#8220;I aimed ter smoke for a leetle spell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The host struck a match and held it while the
broken guest kindled his pipe, then he hurriedly
glanced through his papers to assure himself that
nothing had been disturbed&mdash;and though each sheet
seemed as he had left it, the uneasiness in Spurrier&#8217;s
mind refused to be stilled.</p>
<p>Presumably this bat-blind ragamuffin was no greater
menace to the secrecy of his plans than a bat itself
would have been, yet a glimpse of this letter would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
have been so fatal that he asked himself anxiously,
&#8220;How do I know he&#8217;s not faking?&#8221; The far-fetched
apprehension gathered weight like a snowslide until
suddenly out of it was born a grim determination.</p>
<p>He would make a test.</p>
<p>Noiselessly, while the ugly face that had been
mutilated by a blasting charge gazed straight and
sightlessly at him, Spurrier opened the table drawer
and took from it a heavy calibered automatic pistol.
It was a deadly looking thing and it needed no cocking;
only the silent slipping forward of a safety catch.
In this experiment Spurrier must not startle his guest
by any ominous sound, but he must satisfy himself
that his sight was genuinely dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said the host in a matter-of-fact voice
as he searchingly studied the other face through narrowed
lids, &#8220;that when sight went, the enjoyment of
tobacco went with it.&#8221; As he spoke he raised and
leveled the cocked pistol until its muzzle was pointed
full into the staring face. Deliberately he set his own
features into the baleful stamp of deadly threat, until
his expression was as wicked and ugly as a gargoyle
of hatred.</p>
<p>If the man were by any possibility shamming it
would take cold nerve to sit there without any hint
of confession as this unwarned demonstration was
made against him&mdash;a demonstration that seemed
genuine and murderous. For an instant Spurrier
fancied that he heard the breath rasp in the other&#8217;s
throat, but that, he realized, must have been fancy.
The face itself altered no line of expression, flickered
no eyelid. It remained as it had been, stolid and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
blank, so that the man with the pistol felt ashamed of
his suspicion.</p>
<p>But Spurrier rose and leaned across the table slowly
advancing the muzzle until it almost touched the
bridge of the nose, just between the eyes he was so
severely testing. Still no hint of realization came
from the threatened guest. Then the voice of the
blind man sounded phlegmatically:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what folks say erbout terbaccy an&#8217; blind
men&mdash;but, by crickety, hit <i>ain&#8217;t so</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Spurrier withdrew his pistol and put it back
in the drawer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;he didn&#8217;t read my
letters.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>Across a tree-shaded public square from the
courthouse and &#8220;jail house&#8221; at Carnettsville
stood a building that wore the dejected guise
of uncomforted old age, and among the business signs
nailed about its entrance was the shingle bearing the
name of &#8220;Creed Faggott, Atty. at Law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way to this oracle&#8217;s sanctum lay up a creaking
stairway, and on a brilliant summer day not long after
Spurrier had entertained his blind guest it was climbed
by that guest in person, led by the impish boy whose
young mouth was stained with chewing-tobacco.</p>
<p>This precocious child opened the door and led his
charge in and, from a deal table, Creed Faggott removed
his broganned feet and turned sly eyes upon
the visitors, out of a cadaverous and furtive face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t let no grass grow under your feet, do
you, Joe?&#8221; inquired the lawyer shortly. &#8220;When the
day rolls round, you show up without default or miscarriage.&#8221;
He paused as the boy led the blind man to
a chair and then facetiously capped his interrogation.
&#8220;I reckon I don&#8217;t err in surmisin&#8217; that you&#8217;ve come to
collect your pension?&#8221;</p>
<p>The blind man gazed vacantly ahead. &#8220;Who,
me?&#8221; he inquired with half-witted dullness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you. Who else would I mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s due, ain&#8217;t hit&mdash;my money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Due at noon to-day and noon is still ten minutes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
off. I&#8217;m not sure the company didn&#8217;t make a mistake
in allowing you such a generous compensation for
your accident.&#8221; There was a pause, then Faggott
added argumentatively: &#8220;Your damage suit would
have come to naught, most likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet ain&#8217;t ther way ye talked when I lawed ther
comp&#8217;ny,&#8221; whined the blind man. &#8220;Ye &#8217;peared to be
right ambitious ter settle outen co&#8217;te in them days, Mr.
Faggott.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The company didn&#8217;t want the thing hanging on.
They got cold feet. Well, I&#8217;ll give you your check.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d ruther have hit in cash money&mdash;silver money,&#8221;
stipulated the recipient of the compromise settlement.
&#8220;I kin count <i>thet</i> over by ther feel of hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faggott snorted his disgust but he deposited in the
outstretched palm the amount that fell due on each
quarterly pay day, and the visitor thumbed over every
coin and tested the edges of all with his teeth. After
that, instead of rising to go, he sat silently reflective.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all, ain&#8217;t it,&#8221; demanded the attorney, and
something like a pallid grin lifted the lip corners in the
blind man&#8217;s ugly face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite all,&#8221; replied Joe Givins as he shook his
head. &#8220;No, thar&#8217;s one other leetle matter yit. I&#8217;d love
ter hev ye write me a letter ter ther comp&#8217;ny&#8217;s boss-man
in Looeyville. I kinderly aims ter go thar an&#8217;
see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time it was the attorney who, with an incredulity-freighted
voice, demanded: &#8220;Who, you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Louisville manager,&#8221; announced Faggott
loftily, &#8220;is a man of affairs. The company conducts
its business here through its local counsel&mdash;that&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless an&#8217; notwithstandin&#8217;, I reckon hit&#8217;ll
kinderly pleasure ther boss-man ter talk ter <i>me</i>&mdash;when
he hears what I&#8217;ve got ter tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A light of greed quickened in the shyster&#8217;s narrow
eyes. It was possible that Blind Joe had come by some
scrap of salable information. It had been stipulated
when his damage suit was settled, that he should, paradoxically
speaking, keep his blind eyes open.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Joe,&#8221; the attorney, no longer condescending
of bearing, spoke now with a wheedling insistence,
&#8220;if you&#8217;ve got any tidings, tell &#8217;em to me. I&#8217;m your
friend and I can get the matter before the parties that
hold the purse strings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe Givins stretched out a wavering hand and groped
before him. &#8220;Lead me on outen hyar, boy,&#8221; he gave
laconic command to his youthful varlet. &#8220;I&#8217;m tarryin&#8217;
overlong an&#8217; wastin&#8217; daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s daylight to you, Joe?&#8221; snapped Faggott
brutally, but recognizing his mistake he, at once,
softened his manner to a mollifying tone. &#8220;Set still
a spell an&#8217; let&#8217;s have speech tergether&mdash;an&#8217; a little
dram of licker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten minutes of nimble-witted fencing ensued between
the two sons of avarice, and at their end the
blind man stumped out, carrying in his breast pocket
a note of introduction to a business man in Louisville&mdash;whose
real business was lobbying and directing underground
investigations&mdash;but the lawyer was no wiser
than he had been.</p>
<p>And when eventually from the murky lobby of the
Farmers&#8217; Haven Hotel, which sits between distillery
warehouses in Louisville, the shabby mountaineer was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
led to the office building he sought, he was received
while more presentable beings waited in an anteroom.</p>
<p>It chanced that on the same day John Spurrier
spoke to Dyke Cappeze of Glory.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we went fishing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I asked her
whether she never felt a curiosity for the things beyond
the ridges&mdash;and her eagerness startled me.&#8221;</p>
<p>An abrupt seriousness overspread the older face and
the answering voice was sternly pitched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be profoundly distressed, sir,&#8221; said Cappeze,
&#8220;to have discontent brought home to her. I
should resent it as unfriendly and disloyal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; Spurrier&#8217;s own voice was quickened
into a more argumentative timber, &#8220;she has a splendid
vitality that it&#8217;s a pity to crush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has,&#8221; came the swift retort, &#8220;a contented heart
which it&#8217;s a pity to unsettle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The elder eyes hardened and looked out over the
wall of obstinacy that had immured Dyke Cappeze&#8217;s
life, but his words quivered to a tremor of deep
feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve given her an education of sorts. She knows
more law than some judges, and if she&#8217;s ignorant of
the world of to-day she&#8217;s got a bowing acquaintance
with the classics. I&#8217;m not wholly selfish. If there was
some one&mdash;down below that I could send her to&mdash;some
one who would love her enough because she needs to
be loved&mdash;I&#8217;d stay here alone, and willingly, despite
the fact that it would well-nigh kill me.&#8221; He paused
there and his eyes were broodingly somber, then
almost fiercely he went on: &#8220;I would trust her in no
society where she might be affronted or belittled. I
would rather see her live and die here, talking the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
honest, old crudities of the pioneers, than have her
venture into a life where she could not make her own
terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps she could make her own terms,&#8221; hazarded
Spurrier, and the other snapped his head up indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;yes&mdash;and perhaps not. You yourself
are a man of the world, sir. What would&mdash;one of
your own sort&mdash;have to offer her out there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Under that challenging gaze the man from the East
found himself flushing. It was almost as though under
the hypothetical form of the question, the father had
bluntly warned him off from any interference unless
he came as an avowed suitor. He had no answer and
again the lawyer spoke with the compelling force of
an ultimatum.</p>
<p>&#8220;She must stay here with me, who would die for
her, until she goes to some man who offers her everything
he has to offer; some man who would die for
her, too.&#8221; His voice had fallen into tenderness, but a
stern ring went with his final words. &#8220;Meanwhile,
I stand guard over her like a faithful dog. I may be
old and scarred but, by God, sir, I am vigilant and
devoted!&#8221; He waved his thin hand with a gesture of
dismissal for a closed subject, and in a changed tone
added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve recently heard of two other travelers riding
through&mdash;and they have taken up several land options.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What meaning do you read into it, Mr. Cappeze?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyer shrugged his shoulders. If he had no
explanation to offer, it was plain that he did not regard
the coming of the strangers as meaningless.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going,&#8221; said Spurrier casually, &#8220;to make a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
trip up Snake Fork to the head of Little Quicksand.
Is there any one up there I can call on for lodging
and information?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyer shook his head. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mighty rough
country and sparsely settled. You&#8217;ll find a lavish of
rattlesnakes&mdash;and a few unlettered humans. There&#8217;s
a fellow up there named Sim Colby who might shelter
you overnight. He lives by himself, and has a roof
that sheds the rain. It&#8217;s about all you can ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough,&#8221; smiled Spurrier, and a few days later
he found himself climbing a stiff ascent toward a point
where over the tree-tops a thread of smoke proclaimed
a human habitation.</p>
<p>He was coming unannounced to the house of Sim
Colby, but if he had expected his visit to be an entire
surprise he was mistaken, and if he had known the
agitation that went a little way ahead of him, he would
have made a wide detour and passed the place by.</p>
<p>Sim was hoeing in his steeply pitched field when he
saw and recognized the figure which was yet a half-hour&#8217;s
walk distant, by the meanderings of the trail.
The hoe fell from his hand and his posture stiffened so
inimically that the hound at his feet rose and bristled,
a low growl running half smothered in its throat.</p>
<p>Doubtless, Colby reasoned, Spurrier was coming to
his lonely house with a purpose of venom and punishment,
yet he walked boldly and to the outward glance
he seemed unarmed. Hence it must be that in the
former army officer&#8217;s plan lay some intent more complex
than mere open-and-shut meeting and slaying:
some carefully planned and guileful climax to be approached
by indirection. Very well, he would also
play the game out, burying his suspicion under a guise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
of artlessness, but watching every move&mdash;and when
the moment came striking first.</p>
<p>At a brook, as he hastened toward his house by a
short cut, he knelt to drink, for his throat was
damnably dry, and in the clear water the pasty pallor
and terror of his face was given back to him, and
warned him. But also the mirroring brought another
thought and the thought fathered swift action. In the
army he had been spare and clean-shaven and a scar
had marked his chin. Now he was bearded. He
carried a beefier bulk and an altered appearance.</p>
<p>Could there be any possibility of Spurrier&#8217;s failing
to recognize him&mdash;of his having been, after all, ignorant
of his presence here?</p>
<p>Yet his eyes would be recognizable. They were arrestingly
distinctive, for one of them was pale-blue
and the other noticeably grayish.</p>
<p>By the path he was following, stalks of Jimson weed
grew rank, and Sim, rising from his knees, pulled off
a handful of leaves and crushed them between his
palms. When he had reached the house his first action
was to force from this bruised leafage a few drops of
liquid into a saucer and this juice he carefully injected
into his eyes.</p>
<p>Then he went to the door and squinted up at the
sun. It would be fifteen minutes before Spurrier
would arrive and fifteen minutes might be enough.
He half closed his eyes, because they were stinging
painfully, and sat waiting, to all appearances indolent
and thoughtless.</p>
<p>Spurrier plodded on, measuring the distance to the
smoke thread until he came in view of the cabin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
itself, then he approached slowly since the stiff climb
had winded him.</p>
<p>Now he could see the shingle roof and the log walls,
trailed over with morning-glory vines, and in the door
the slouching figure of a man. He came on and the
native rose lazily.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s John Spurrier,&#8221; called out the traveler,
&#8220;and Lawyer Cappeze cited you to me as a man who
might shelter me overnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who had deserted chewed nonchalantly
on a grass straw and regarded the other incuriously&mdash;which
was a master bit of dissembling. Between
them, it seemed to Sim Colby who had once been
Private Grant, lay the body of a murdered captain.
Between them, too, lay the guilt of his assassination.
To the Easterner&#8217;s appraisal this heavy-set mountaineer
with unkempt hair and ragged beard was
merely a local type and yet in one respect he was unforgettable.</p>
<p>It was his eyes. They were arrestingly uncommon
eyes and, once seen, they must be remembered. What
was the quality that made one notice them so instantly,
Spurrier questioned himself. Then he realized.</p>
<p>They were inkily black eyes, but that was not all.
There seemed to be in them no line of demarcation
between iris and pupil&mdash;only liquid pools of jet.</p>
<p>The two men sat there as the shadows lengthened
and talked &#8220;plumb friendly&#8221; as Colby later admitted
to himself. They smoked Spurrier&#8217;s &#8220;fotched-on&#8221;
tobacco and drank native distillation from the demijohn
that Colby took down from its place on a rafter.
Yet the host was filling each tranquilly flowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
minute with the intensive planning of a hospitality that
was, like Macbeth&#8217;s, to end in murder.</p>
<p>Spurrier would sleep in an alcovelike room which
could be locked from the outside. Back through the
brush was a spot of quicksand where a body would
leave no trace. One thing only troubled the planning
brain. He wished he could learn just who knew of
his guest&#8217;s coming here; just what precautions that
guest had taken before embarking on such a venture.</p>
<p>From outside came a shout, interrupting these reflections,
and Sim was at once on his feet facing the
front door, with a surreptitious hand inside his shirt,
and one eye covertly watching Spurrier, even as he
looked out. A snarl, too, drew his lips into an unpleasant
twist.</p>
<p>The Easterner put down to mountain caution the
amazing swiftness with which the other had come
from his hulking proneness to upstanding alertness.
But with equal rapidity, Sim&#8217;s pose relaxed into ease
and he shouted a welcome as the door darkened with
a figure physically splendid in its spare strength and
commanding height.</p>
<p>Spurrier rose and found himself looking into a face
with most engaging eyes and teeth that flashed white
in smiling.</p>
<p>For a moment as the newcomer gazed at Sim Colby
his expression mirrored some sort of surprise and
his lips moved as if to speak, but Spurrier could not
see, because Colby&#8217;s back was turned, the warning
glance that shot between the two, and the big fellow&#8217;s
lips closed again without giving utterance to whatever
he had been on the point of saying&mdash;something to
do with eyes that had mystifyingly changed their color.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Mister Spurrier, this hyar&#8217;s Sam Mosebury,&#8221; announced
the host. &#8220;Mebby ye mout of heered tell of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier nodded. So this was the outlaw against
whose terrorism old Cappeze had broken his Quixote
lances, the windmill that had unhorsed him; the man
with a criminal record at which a wild region trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heered tell of Mr. Spurrier, too,&#8221; vouchsafed
the murderer equably. &#8220;He&#8217;s a friend of old Dyke
Cappeze&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;furriner&#8221; made no denial. Though he had
been sitting with his head in the jaws of death ever
since he entered this door, it had been without any
presentiment of danger. Now he felt the menace of
this terrorist&#8217;s presence, and that menace was totally
fictitious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cappeze has befriended me,&#8221; he answered
stiffly. &#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s not a recommendation to you,
is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who had newly entered laughed. He drew
a chair forward and seated himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon, Mr. Spurrier, hit ain&#8217;t none of my business
one way ner t&#8217;other,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anyhow, hit
ain&#8217;t no reason why you an&#8217; me kain&#8217;t be friends,
is hit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any difficulty with me,&#8221; laughed
Spurrier in relief, &#8220;if it doesn&#8217;t with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Mosebury looked at him, then his voice came
with a dry chuckle of humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over at my dwellin&#8217; house,&#8221; he announced with a
pleasant drawl, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got me a pet mockin&#8217;-bird&mdash;an&#8217;
I&#8217;ve got me a pet cat, too. Ther three of us meks up
ther fam&#8217;ly over thar.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>Spurrier looked at the strong-featured face as he
prompted, &#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waal,&#8221; Sam Mosebury waved his hand, and even
his gestures had a spacious bigness about them, &#8220;ef
God Almighty didn&#8217;t see fit fer thet thar bird an&#8217; thet
thar cat ter love one another&mdash;I don&#8217;t seek ter alter
His plan. Nonetheless I sets a passel of store by both
of &#8217;em.&#8221; He filled his pipe, then his words became
musing, possibly allegorical. &#8220;Mebby some day I&#8217;ll
<i>ree</i>lax a leetle mite too much in watchin&#8217; an&#8217; then I
reckon ther cat&#8217;ll kill ther bird&mdash;but thet&#8217;s accordin&#8217;
ter nature, too, an&#8217; deespite I&#8217;ll grieve some, I won&#8217;t
disgust ther cat none.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night Spurrier lay on the same shuck-filled
mattress with the man whom the law had not been
strong enough to hang, and for a while he remained
wakeful, reflecting on the strangeness of his bed-fellowship.</p>
<p>But, had he known it, his life was saved that night
because the murderer had arrived and provided an
interfering presence when the plans on foot required
solitude.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>Perhaps old Cappeze had spoken too late when
he sounded his sharp warning to the newcomer
against unsettling the simple contentment of his
daughter&#8217;s mind. Always realizing his transient status
in the aloofness of this life, Spurrier had scrupulously
guarded his contact with the girl who belonged
to it and who had no prospect of escaping it. He had
sought to behave to her as he might have behaved to
a child, with grave or gay friendliness untouched by
those gallantries that might have been misunderstood,
yet treating her intelligence with full and adult
equality.</p>
<p>But his inclination to see more of her than formerly
was one that he indulged because it gave him pleasure
and because a failure to do so would have had the
aspect of churlishness.</p>
<p>Those self-confessed traces of snobbery that adhered
to this courtier at the throne of wealth, were attributes
of which the girl saw nothing. Neither did
she see the shell of cynicism which Spurrier had cultivated
and this was not because her insight failed of
keenness, but because in these surroundings they were
dormant qualities.</p>
<p>The self that he displayed here was the self of the
infectious smile, of the frank boldness and good
humor that had made him beloved among his army
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
mess-mates before these more gracious qualities had
been winter-killed by misfortune.</p>
<p>So he was the picturesque and charming version of
himself, and he became to Glory an object of hero
worship, whose presence made the day eventful and
whose intervals of absence were filled with dreams of
his next coming.</p>
<p>It was about this time that John Spurrier, the &#8220;opportunity
hound,&#8221; made a disquieting discovery. It
came upon him one night as he sat on the porch of
Dyke Cappeze&#8217;s log house at twilight, with pipes glowing
and seductive influences stealing into the senses.
Daylight color had faded to the mistiness of tarnished
silver except for a lemon afterglow above western
ridges that were violet-gray, and the evening star was
a single lantern hanging softly luminous, where soon
there would be many others.</p>
<p>Cadenced and melodious as a lullaby fraught with
the magic of the solitudes, the night song of frog and
whippoorwill rose stealingly out of silence, and the
materialist who had been city bound so much since
conviction of crime had shadowed his life discovered
the thing which threatened danger.</p>
<p>It came to him as his eyes met those of Glory, who
sat in the doorway itself&mdash;since she, at least, need not
fear to show her face to any lurking rifleman.</p>
<p>The yellow lamplight from within outlined the
lovely contour of her rounded cheek and throat and
livened her hair, but it was not only her undeniable
beauty that caused Spurrier sudden anxiety. It was
the eyes and what he read in them. Instantly as their
gazes engaged she dropped her glance but, in the moment
before she had masked her expression, Spurrier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
knew that she had fallen in love with him. The eyes
had said it in that instant when he had surprised them.
They had immediately seized back their secret and
hidden it away, but not in time.</p>
<p>The opportunity hound rose and knocked the ash
from his pipe. He wondered whether old Dyke Cappeze,
sitting there inscrutable and dimly shaped in the
shadows, had shared his discovery&mdash;that grizzled old
watchdog who was not too far gone to fight for his
own with the strength of his yellowed fangs.</p>
<p>The visitor shook hands and walked moodily home,
and as he went he sought to dismiss the matter from
his mind. It was all a delusion, he assured himself;
some weird psychological quirk born of a man&#8217;s innate
vanity; incited by a girl&#8217;s physical allurement. He
would go to sleep and to-morrow he would laugh at
the moonshine problem. But he did not find it so easy
to sleep. He remembered one of those men in the
islands who had become a melancholiac. The fellow
had been normal at one moment; then without warning
something like an impenetrable shadow had struck
across him. He had never come out of the shadow.
So this disquiet&mdash;though it was abnormal elation
rather than melancholy, had suddenly become a fact
with himself, and instead of dismissing it Spurrier
found himself reacting to it. Not only was Glory
Cappeze in love with him but&mdash;absurdity of absurdities&mdash;he
was in love with Glory!</p>
<p>It was as irreconcilable with all the logic of his
own nature as any conceivable thing could be, yet it
was undeniably true.</p>
<p>But Spurrier had been there in the hills when summer
had overcome winter. He had seen trickles of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
water grow into freshets and feed rivers. He had
seen clouds as large as one&#8217;s hand swell abruptly into
tempests that cannonaded mightily through the peaks,
with the lashing of torrents, the sting of lightnings,
and the onsweep of hurricanes. He had seen the pink
flower of laurel and rhododendron make fragrant
magic over wastes of chocolate and slag-gray mountain
sides, and in himself something akin to these elemental
forces had declared itself. He found himself two
men, and though he swore resolutely that his brain
should dominate and govern, he also recognized in
himself the man of new-born impulses who drew the
high air into his chest with a keen elation, and who
wanted to laugh at the artificial things that life has
wrought into its structure of accepted civilization.</p>
<p>That insurgent part of himself found a truer congeniality
in the company of grizzled old Dyke Cappeze
than that of Martin Harrison; a stronger comradeship
in the frank laugh of Glory than in the cool
intelligence of Vivien&#8217;s smile.</p>
<p>Glory&#8217;s brain was as alert as quicksilver, and her
heart as high and clean as the hills. Yet in his own
world these two would be as unplaced as gypsies
strayed from their dilapidated caravan. Moreover, it
was ordained that he was to win his game and upon
him was to be conferred an accolade&mdash;the hand, in
marriage, of his principal&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p>Spurrier laughed a little grimly to himself. Of the
woman whose hand had been half-promised him he
could think dispassionately and of this other, whom
he could not take with him into his world of artificial
values, he could not think at all without a pounding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
of pulses and a tumult which he thought he had
left behind him with his early youth.</p>
<p>In character and genuine metal of mind, Glory was
the superior of most of those women he knew, yet because
she was country bred and trained to a code that
did not obtain elsewhere, she could no more be removed
from her setting than a blooming eidelweiss
could be successfully transplanted in a conservatory.
He himself was fixed into a certain place which he had
attained by fighting his way, in the figurative sense at
least, over the bodies of the less successful and the
less enduring. It was too late for him to transplant
himself, and he and she were plants of differing soil,
as though one were a snow flower and one a tropic
growth.</p>
<p>Also there were immediate things of which to
think, such as an unexpired threat upon his life.</p>
<p>Already he had escaped the assassin&#8217;s first effort,
and he had no guess where the enmity lay which had
actuated that attack. That it still existed and would
strike again he had a full realization. He was not
walking in the shadow of dread but, because he knew
of the menace lurking where all the faces were
friendly, he had begun to feel that companionship of
suspense: that nearness of something in hiding under
which men lived here; and under which women grew
old in their twenties.</p>
<p>And it is not given to a man to live under such conditions,
and remain the man who fights only across
mahogany tabletops in offices. Yet John Spurrier
scornfully reasoned that if he could not remain himself
even in a new and altered habitat, he was a weakling,
and he had no intention of proving a weakling.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>His hand had grasped the plow-haft and, for the
present, at least, his loyalty belonged to his undertaking.</p>
<p>This inward conflict went with him as he rode
across the singing hills to gather up his mail at the
nearest post office and he told himself, &#8220;I am a fool
to ponder it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then his thoughts ran on: &#8220;It is dwelling on factitious
things that gives them force. Life presents a
Janus aspect of the double-faced at times, but a man
must choose his way and ignore the turnings. Glory
has pure charm. She has a quick mind and a captivating
beauty, but so far as I&#8217;m concerned, she is simply
out of the picture. I could be mad about her, if I
let myself&mdash;but presumably I am not adrift on a
gulf stream of emotionalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he had spent an hour in the dusty little town
and turned again into the coolness of the hills, he dismounted
under the shade of a &#8220;cucumber tree&#8221; and
glanced through those letters that were still unopened.
One envelope was addressed in a hand that tantalized
memory with a half sense of the familiar, and Spurrier&#8217;s
brow contracted in perplexity.</p>
<p>Then his face grew abruptly grave. &#8220;By heavens!&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;It&#8217;s Withers&mdash;Major Withers! What
can he be writing about?&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened it and drew out the sheet of paper, and,
as he read, his expression went through the gamut
of surprise and incredulity to a settled sternness of
purpose that made his face stony.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s true,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;the man is mine to
kill! No, not to kill, either, but to take alive at all
costs.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>He stood for a moment, his sinewy body answering
to a tremor of deeply shaken emotion. Had he been
mountain-bred and feud-nurtured, the sinister glitter
of his eyes could have been no more relentless. He
was for that moment a man dedicating himself to the
blood oath of vengeance.</p>
<p>Then he composed his features and smoothed out
the letter that his clenched fingers had unconsciously
crumpled. Again he read what Major Withers had to
say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am writing because though I infer that you have succeeded
in material ways, I have heard nothing of your
progress in clearing your name and I know that until that
is accomplished, no success will be complete for you.</p>
<p>Quite recently I have had as my striker a fellow named
Wiley, who used to be in your platoon&mdash;and I have talked
with him a good bit. Not long ago he declared to me his
belief that Private Grant who is listed as officially dead,
did <i>not</i> die in the Islands.</p>
<p>He seems to think that Grant made a clean getaway and
went back to the Kentucky mountains from which he came.
He confesses that he gets this idea from nothing more
tangible than casual hints dropped by Private Severance,
whose discharge came shortly after you left us, yet his
impression is so strong as to amount to conviction. Possibly
if you could trace Severance you might learn something.
It&#8217;s a vague clew, I admit, but I pass it along to you for
whatever it may be worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slowly, as though his tireless limbs had grown suddenly
old, Spurrier mounted and rode on with reins
hanging. He was so deep in thought that he forgot
the other unopened letters in his pocket.</p>
<p>Grant might be in these same hills with himself;
Grant upon whom his counsel had sought to place the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
blame for the murder of Captain Comyn. If they
could meet alone for the period of a brief interview,
either that question would be finally answered or in
the reckoning one of them would have to die.</p>
<p>But how to trace him in this ragged territory covering
a great and broken area&mdash;a territory which God
had seemed to build, as a haven and a hiding place for
men who sought concealment? Grant would in all
likelihood see him first and&mdash;he entertained no illusions
as to the result&mdash;the deserter would kill him on
sight. On the other hand, it would do Spurrier no
good to kill Grant. If Grant were to serve him it
must be with a confession wrung from living lips,
and on oath.</p>
<p>Of course, too, the years would have changed Grant
so that if they came face to face he would probably
fail to recognize the man he had known only in khaki.</p>
<p>The scarred chin? A beard would obliterate that.
The stature? Added weight or lost weight would
make it seem another man&#8217;s.</p>
<p>By processes of elimination Spurrier culled over the
possibilities until at length his glance brightened.</p>
<p>In one particular Private Grant could scarcely disguise
himself. His eyes were in a fashion mismated.
One was light gray and one pale blue. Yes, if ever
they met he would have his clew in that.</p>
<p>And that memory reminded him that he had recently
been impressed to an unusual degree by a pair
of eyes. Whose were they? Oh, yes, he remembered
now. It was the man at whose house he had met Sam
Mosebury&mdash;Sim Colby who dwelt over beyond Clubfoot
Branch.</p>
<p>But Colby&#8217;s eyes had been noticeable by reason of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
their extraordinary blackness. So that only helped
him in so far as it enabled him to eliminate from all
the thousands of possible men the one man, Sim
Colby.</p>
<p>The afternoon had spent itself toward sunset as he
dismounted and stabled his horse, and it was with a
face still somberly thoughtful that he fitted his key
into the padlock which held his door and entered.</p>
<p>The interior was dusky in contrast with the outer
light, but from one window a shaft of golden radiance
slanted inward and in it the dust motes danced.</p>
<p>Spurrier paused and glanced about him, but before
he had thrown down the hat he had taken from his
perspiring forehead, a sound hideously unmistakable
caused his heartbeat to miss its rhythm and pound in
commotion.</p>
<p>Every man has his one terror, or, at least, one antipathy
which he is unable to treat with customary calmness.
With Spurrier it was everything reptilian. In
the islands he had dreaded the snake menace more
than fever or head hunters. Now, from the darkened
floor near his feet came the vicious whir of rattles, and
as his eyes flashed toward the sound he saw coiled
there a huge snake with its flat, arrow-shaped head
sinuously waving from side to side.</p>
<p>With an agility made lightning-quick by necessity,
he leaped aside and, at the same instant, the snake
launched itself with such venomous force that the
sound of its striking and falling on the puncheon floor
was like the lashing of a mule whip. The man had
felt the disturbed air of its passing as of a sword
stroke that had narrowly missed him.</p>
<p>But he had no leisure to regain the breath that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
caught startled in his throat, before, from his left, he
heard again the ominous note of warning, and felt
his scalp creep with horror. The place which he had
left locked and believed to be mosquito proof, now
seemed alive with the loathsome trespassers.</p>
<p>As Spurrier leaped for his couch he heard again the
sound of a living coil released and its hawserlike lashing
of the floor. Now he could see more plainly and,
calculating his distance, he jumped for the table from
which he could reach the loaded shotgun that hung
on his wall. If he fell short, he would come down
at their mercy&mdash;but he landed securely and without
capsizing his support. His elevation gave him a precarious
sort of safety, but on the floor below him he
counted three rattlesnakes, crawling and recoiling;
their cold-blooded eyes following his movements with
baleful intentness.</p>
<p>Spurrier was conscious of his trembling hands as
he leveled the weapon, and of a crawling sensation of
loathing along his spine.</p>
<p>Twice the gun roared, splintering the flooring and
spattering its ricochetting pellets, and two of the
rattlers twisted in convulsive but harmless writhings.
But the third head&mdash;and it seemed the largest of the
three&mdash;had withdrawn under the cot. He was not
even sure that these three made up the total. There
might be others.</p>
<p>With painstaking care Spurrier came down and
armed himself with a stout hickory flail which had
been used in other days by some housewife in her
primitive laundry work as a &#8220;battling stick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he advanced to the battle, swinging one end of
the cot wide and shiftily sidestepping. The rattler
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
which lay in piled circles of coppery length regarded
him with steely venom, turning its swaying head deliberately
as its enemy circled. With the startling
abruptness of an electric buzzer it warned and sprang.
He escaped by an uncomfortable margin and attacked
it with the flail before it could rearrange its coils.
Finally he stood panting with exertion over the scene
of slaughter.</p>
<p>As he searched the place with profoundest particularity
his mind was analyzing the strange invasion.
His house was as tight as he had thought it. There
was no cranny that would have let in three large
rattlers. How had they come there?</p>
<p>Spurrier went out and studied his door. The hasps
that held his padlock were in place, but the woodwork
about them had been recently scarred. The lock fastenings
had been pulled out and replaced.</p>
<p>With a nervous moisture on his brow the man recognized
the fiendish ingenuity of his mysterious
enemy. These slithering creatures had come here by
human agency as brute accomplices in the murder that
had failed from the rifle muzzle. The pertinacity and
cunning of the scheme&#8217;s anonymous author gave
promise of eventfulness hereafter.</p>
<p>Had he been struck, according to the evident intention,
as he entered his house, he would probably
have died there, unsuccored, leaving the door open.
The rattlers would either have found their way out
after that, or, when his body was discovered, the open
door would have explained their presence inside, and
no suspicion of a man&#8217;s conspiracy would have remained.</p>
<p>One thing stood out clear in Spurrier&#8217;s summing-up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Whatever the source of the enmity which pursued
him, it had its nerve center in an ingenious brain
and it threw about itself that element of mystery
which a timid man would have found terrifying and
unendurable. Also it operated with a patience which
was a manifest of its unswerving determination.
Effort might be expected to follow effort until success
came&mdash;or the unknown plotter were discovered
and disposed of.</p>
<p>Yet the author of these malignant attempts worked
with an unflurried deliberation, allowing passive intervals
to elapse between activities, like the volcano
that rests in the quiet of false security between fatal
eruptions.</p>
<p>Of course, the letter with the mention of Private
Grant might be a clew of identity, yet calm reflection
discounted that assumption as a wild and unconfirmed
grasping out after something tangible.</p>
<p>Perhaps Spurrier as nearly approached the absolute
in physical fearlessness as it is given to man to
come&mdash;but the mystery of a pursuing hatred which
could not be openly faced, filled him with a sense of
futility, and the futility inspired rage which was unsettling
and must be combated.</p>
<p>That night he lay long awake, and after he had
fallen asleep he came often to a sudden and wide-eyed
wakefulness again at the sound of an owl&#8217;s call or the
creaking of a tree limb.</p>
<p>The next morning found him restless of spirit, and
it occurred to him that his secret enemy might be lurking
near to inspect the results of his handiwork, so
he went down to the road and hung the three dead
rattlesnakes along the fence where no passer-by could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
miss seeing their twisted and mutilated lengths. That
should be his retort to any inquiring and hostile eye,
that he was alive and the creatures put there to destroy
him had paid with their lives.</p>
<p>From a place screened from view he meant to watch
that gruesome exhibit and mark its effect upon any
one who paused to inspect it. Possibly in that way a
clew might be vouchsafed&mdash;but he did not at once take
cover in the thickets.</p>
<p>It was a glorious morning. The sun had ripped
away the mists that, in the mountains, always hang
damp and veillike between gray dawning and colorful
day. The cool forest recesses were vocal with the
twitterings and song from feathered throats.</p>
<p>Spurrier sat down by the road and gave himself up
to thoughts that it was safer to banish: thoughts that
came with those sights and sounds and that made
long-stilled pulses awaken and throb in him.</p>
<p>This morning made him feel Glory&#8217;s presence and
gave him a fine recklessness as to responsibility and
consequence. Suddenly he came to himself and seemed
to hear the cool cynicism of Martin Harrison&#8217;s voice
inquiring, as it had once actually inquired: &#8220;Growing
sentimental?&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled himself together and stiffened his expression
into one more suitable upon the face of a man
who has taken the severe vows of service to a cold
ambition.</p>
<p>But a little later he heard a sound and looked up
sidewise to see Glory herself standing near him in the
road; a materialization of the truant dreams he had
been entertaining.</p>
<p>She wore a dress whose simplicity accentuated the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
slender erectness of her young body and the litheness
of her carriage. Her hair hung in braids and the
sunbonnet had fallen back from the brightness of her
hair. In her eyes played the violet lights of a merriment
that lifted and curved her lips beguilingly.</p>
<p>Spurrier came to his feet, and perhaps Glory, who
had succumbed to her moment of self-revelation there
on the twilight porch, had her revenge now. For that
first startled moment as their glances met, the eyes
that looked into hers were lover&#8217;s eyes, and their unspoken
message was courtship. If he maintained the
stoic&#8217;s silence forever, as to words, at least his heart
had spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Heaven,&#8221; said the man slowly, and the
tremor of his voice was out of keeping with the ingrained
poise of his usual self-command, &#8220;when they
called you Glory, they didn&#8217;t misname you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flushed pink, and he took a step toward her
with the absorbed intensity of a sleep-walker.</p>
<p>Glory stood there&mdash;watched him coming and did
not move. To her, though she had sought to hide it,
he had become the One Man. Her unconfessed love
had magnified and deified him&mdash;and now his own eyes
were blazing responsively with love for her!</p>
<p>Suddenly she was shaken by a rapturous tremor
that seemed almost like swooning or being lifted on
some powerful wave that swept her clear of the earth,
so that she made no effort at disguise, but let the
laughing light in her eyes become softer, yet more
glowingly intense.</p>
<p>It was as if they had met in the free realm of
dreams where there are no hamperings of impossibility.
As he drew near her, his arms came out, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
halted so that, under that same delightful sense of
irresponsibility, it seemed to her quite natural to step
into their welcome.</p>
<p>Possibly the happenings of yesterday and the sleepless
hours of last night had left Spurrier momentarily
light-headed. Certainly had one of the rattlers stung
him and poisoned his reason, he could not be doing a
thing more foreign to his program of intention.</p>
<p>He felt his arms close about her; felt the fragrance
of her breath, found himself pressing his kisses on
lips that welcomed them, and forgot everything except
that this was a moment of ecstasy and passion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>For a while they stood there together in the narrow
road to whose edges the dense greenery
came down massed and dewy. Their breath
was quick with the excitement of that moment when
the hills and the rocks that upheld them seemed to
them palpitant and gloriously shaken. Then they
heard the lumbering of wheels, and with one impulse
that needed no expression in words they turned
through a gorge which ran at right angles into the
stillness of the woods&mdash;and away from interruption.</p>
<p>Spurrier had, it seemed to him, stepped through a
curtain in life and found beyond it a door of which
he had not known. It seemed natural that he and
Glory should be going hand in hand into that place of
dreams like children at play and hearing joyous voices
that were mute and nonexistent in the world of commonplace
and fact.</p>
<p>He did not even pause to reflect that this was a
continuation of the same ravine in which an assassin&#8217;s
bullet had once so narrowly missed him. Yesterday,
too, was forgotten.</p>
<p>Just now he was young in his heart again, and had
love for his talisman. Actuality had been dethroned
by some dream wizardry and left him free of obligation
to reason. Then he heard Glory&#8217;s voice low-pitched
and a little frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;It kain&#8217;t&mdash;can&#8217;t&mdash;be true. It&#8217;s just a dream!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>A flash of sanity, like the shock of a cold plunge,
brought the thought that, from her lips, had sounded
a warning. This was the moment, if ever, to draw
back and take counsel of common sense. Now it
would be easier than later to abase himself and confess
that in this midsummer&#8217;s madness was no substance
or color of reality&mdash;that he stood unalterably
pledged to her renunciation.</p>
<p>But the earthquake does not still itself at the height
of its tremor and the cyclone does not stop dead with
its momentum unspent. Years of calculated and
nerve-trying self-command were exacting their toll
in the satisfaction of outbreak. Spurrier&#8217;s emotional
self was in volcanic eruption, the more molten and
lava-hot for the prolonged dormancy of a sealed
crater.</p>
<p>He caught the girl again and pressed her so close
that the commotion of her heart came throbbing
against him through the yielding softness of her
breast; and the agitation of her breath on his face was
a little tempest of acquiescent sweetness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it seem real, now?&#8221; he challenged as he
released her enough to let her breathe, yet held her
imprisoned, and she nodded, radiant-eyed, and answered
in a voice half bewildered and more than half
burdened with self-reproach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even hang back,&#8221; she made confession.
&#8220;I just walked right into your arms the minute you
held them out. I didn&#8217;t seem able to help myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly her eyes, impenitent once more, danced
with mischief and her smile broke like a sun flash over
her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d had the power of witchcraft, I&#8217;d have put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
the spell on you, Jack,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I had to make
you love me. I just <i>had</i> to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think you had&mdash;that power, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed contentedly as a man may who shifts
all responsibility for an indiscretion to a force
stronger than his own volition.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she went on as if seeking to make illogic
seem logical. &#8220;From the first&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t think of
you except with storm thoughts. I couldn&#8217;t keep my
heart quiet, when I was with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At first,&#8221; he reminded her, &#8220;you wanted to kill
me. I heard you confiding to Rover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes grew seriously deep and undefensive in
their frankness. It was the candor of a woman&#8217;s pride
in conquest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure yet,&#8221; she said almost fiercely, &#8220;that
I wouldn&#8217;t almost rather kill you than&mdash;lose you to
any other girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vaguely and as yet remotely, Spurrier&#8217;s consciousness
was pricked with a forecast of reality&#8217;s veto, but
the present spoke in passion and the future whispered
weakly in platitudes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t lose me,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I&#8217;m yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; went on Glory, &#8220;you seemed a long way
off. You were the man who did big things in the
world outside. You were&mdash;always cool and&mdash;calculating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory,&#8221; his words came with the rush of impetuosity
for already the whispers of warning were gaining
in volume, and impulse was struggling for its new
freedom, &#8220;the man you&#8217;ve seen to-day is one I haven&#8217;t
known myself before. Chilled calculation and self-repression
have been the articles of my creed. I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
been crusted with those obsessions like a ship&#8217;s hull
with barnacles. Did you know that when vessels pass
through the Panama Canal, the barnacles drop off?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, and her lips twisted into something
like wistfulness as she dropped unconsciously into
vernacular. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lavish of things I don&#8217;t know.
You&#8217;ve got to learn &#8217;em all to me&mdash;I mean teach them
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he went on slowly, &#8220;steamers that pass
through the fresh water, from salt to salt, automatically
cleanse their plates. You&#8217;ve been fresh water to
me, Glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; she declared with tempestuous anxiety,
&#8220;you say I&#8217;ve changed you. I&#8217;ll try to change myself,
too, all the ways I can&mdash;all the ways you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you changed,&#8221; he objected. &#8220;If you
were changed, it wouldn&#8217;t be you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; she persisted, &#8220;you&#8217;d like me better if I
were taller or had black eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder now,&#8221; he teased with the whimsey of the
moment, &#8220;what you would look like with black eyes?
I can&#8217;t imagine it. Will you do that for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to our house to-night,&#8221; she irrelevantly commanded.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d come to-night if I had to swim
the Hellespont.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when he had left her an hour later at the crossroads
and started back, his eyes fell on the ugly shapes
of the three rattlesnakes, over which he had forgotten
to keep watch and which she had not even seen, and
yesterday came back with the impact of undisguised
realization. Yesterday and to-morrow stood out again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
in their own solid proportions and to-day stood like a
slender wisp of heart&#8217;s desire shouldered between uncompromising
giants of fact.</p>
<p>Spurrier could no longer deny that his personal
world centered about Glory; that away from her
would be only the unspeakable bleakness of lonely
heart hunger.</p>
<p>But it was equally certain that he could not abandon
everything upon which he had underpinned his
future, and in that structure was no niche which she
could occupy.</p>
<p>Sitting alone in his house with a chill ache at his
heart and facing a dilemma that seemed without solution,
he knew for once the tortures of terror. For
once he could not face the future intrepidly.</p>
<p>He had recognized when the army had stigmatized
him and cast him out, that only by iron force and aggression
could he break his way through to success.
He was enlisted in a warfare captained by financiers
of major caliber and committed to a struggle out of
which victory would bring him not only wealth, but
a place of his own among such financiers&mdash;a place
which Glory could not share.</p>
<p>He and his principals alike were fighting for the
prizes of the looting victor in a battle without chivalry,
and whether he won or was crushed by American
Oil and Gas, the native landholder must be ground
and bruised between the impact of clashing forces. In
the trail of his victory, no less than theirs, would be
human wreckage.</p>
<p>Sitting before his dead hearth while the afternoon
shadows slanted and lengthened, Spurrier wondered
what agonies had wracked the heart of Napoleon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
when he was called upon to choose between Josephine
and a dynasty. For even in his travail the egoist
thought of himself and his ambitions in Napoleonic
terms.</p>
<p>As he sat there alone with silences about his lonely
cabin that seemed speaking in still voices of vastness,
the poignant personality of his thoughts brought him,
by the strange anomaly of life, to realizations that
were not merely personal.</p>
<p>Glory had won his heart and it was as though in
doing so she had also made his feelings quicken for
her people: these people from whose poverty, hospitality
and kindness had been poured out to him:
these people who had taken him at first with reserve
and then accepted him with faith.</p>
<p>He had eaten their bread and salt. He had drunk
their illicit whiskey, given to him with no fear that
he would betray them even in the lawlessness which to
them seemed honorable and fair.</p>
<p>And yet his purpose here, was the single one of enabling
a certain group of money-grabbing financiers
to triumph over another group at the cost of the
mountaineer land-holders. It was not because, if he
succeeded, there would not be enough of legitimate
profit to enrich all, but because in a campaign of
secrecy he could make a confidant of no one. If the
enterprise were carried through at all he must have
secured, for principals who would abate nothing and
give back nothing, the necessary property bought on
the basis of barren farming land. Were it his own
endeavor he could first plunder and develop and then
make restitution, but acting as an agent he could no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
more do that than the soldier who has unconditionally
surrendered, can subsequently demand terms.</p>
<p>The man who had been a plunger at gaming table
and race track, who had succeeded as an imitator of
schemes that attracted major capital, was of necessity
one of imagination. Perhaps had life dealt him
different cards, Spurrier would have been a novelist
or even a poet, for that imagination which he had put
into heavy harness was also capable of flights into
phantasy and endowed with something almost mystic.</p>
<p>Now under the stress of this conflict in his mind, as
he sat before his hearth in shadows that were vague of
light and shape, that unaccustomed surrender to imagination
possessed him, peopling the dimness with
shapes that seemed actual.</p>
<p>His eye fell upon the empty three-legged stool that
stood on the opposite side of the hearth, and as though
he were looking at one of those motion picture effects
which show, in double negative one character confronting
his dual and separate self, he seemed to see a
figure sitting there and regarding him out of contemptuous
eyes.</p>
<p>It was the figure of a very young man clad in the
tunic of a graduating West Point cadet and it was a
figure that bore itself with the prideful erectness of
one who regards his right to wear his uniform as a
privilege of knighthood. For Spurrier was fancying
himself confronted by the man he had been in those
days of eager forward-looking, and of almost religious
resolve to make of himself a soldier in the best
meaning of the word. Then as his eyes closed for a
moment under the vividness of the fancy, the figure
dissolved into its surroundings of shadow and near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
the stool with folded arms and a bitterer scorn stood
a lieutenant in khaki.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is what you have come to be,&#8221; said the
imaginary Spurrier blightingly to the actual Spurrier.
&#8220;A looter and brigand no better than the false <i>amigos</i>
that I fought over there. I was a gentleman and you
are a cad!&#8221;</p>
<p>Had the man been dreaming in sleep instead of
wakefulness, his vision could hardly have worn habiliments
of greater actuality, and he found himself retorting
in hot defensiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever I am you made me. It was you who
was disgraced. It is because I was once you that I am
now I. You left me no choice but to fight with the
weapons that came to hand, and those weapons were
predatory.... If I have deliberately hardened myself
it is only as soldiers of other days put on coats of mail&mdash;because
soft flesh could not survive the mace and
broadsword.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you win your prizes, if you ever win
them,&#8221; the accusing vision appeared to retort, &#8220;you
will have paid for them by spending all that was honorable
in yourself; all that was generous and soldierly.
When you were I, you led a charge across rice paddies
without cover and under a withering fire. For
that you were mentioned in dispatches and you had a
paragraph in the Army and Navy Journal. Have you
ever won a prize since then, that meant as much to
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>John Spurrier came to his feet, with a groan in his
throat. His temples were moist and marked with a
tracery of outstanding veins and his hands were
clenched.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he exclaimed aloud. &#8220;Give me back
the name and the uniform I had then, and see how
gladly I&#8217;ll tell these new masters to go to hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Startled at the sound of his own voice arguing with
a fantasy as with a fact, the man sank back again into
his chair and covered his face with his spread hands.
But shutting out sight did not serve to shut out the
images of his fancy.</p>
<p>He saw himself hired out to &#8220;practical&#8221; overlords
and sent to prey on friends, then he rose and stood
confronting the empty stool where the dream-accuser
in uniform had stood and once more he spoke aloud.
As he did so it seemed that the figure returned and
stood waiting, stern and noncommittal, while he addressed
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the success I need, and the independence
it carries, and I&#8217;ll spend my life exonerating my name.
I&#8217;ll go back to the islands and live among the natives
till I find a man who will tell the truth. I&#8217;ll move
heaven and earth&mdash;but that takes money. I&#8217;ve always
stood, in this business, with wealth just beyond my
grasp&mdash;always promised, never realized. Let me realize
it and be equipped to fight for vindication. These
men I serve have the prizes to dispense, but I am
bound hand and foot to them. They take their pay in
advance. Once victorious I can break with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And these people who have befriended you,&#8221; questioned
the mentor voice, &#8220;what of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love them. They are her people. I shall seem to
plunder them, but if my plans succeed I shall be in a
position to make terms&mdash;and my terms shall be theirs.
Until I succeed I must seem false to them. God
knows I&#8217;m paying for that too. I love Glory!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>Suddenly Spurrier wiped a hand across a clammy
forehead and stood looking about his room, empty
save for himself. He seemed a man who had been
through a delirium. But he reached no conclusion,
and when twilight found him tramping toward the
Cappeze house it was with a heart that beat with anticipation&mdash;while
it sought refuge in postponed decision.</p>
<p>When Glory received him in the lamp-lighted room
he halted in amazement, for the girl who stood there
with a mischievous smile on her lips no longer looked
at him out of eyes violet-blue, but black as liquid jet.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you do that?&#8221; he demanded in a voice
blank with astonishment. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sheer impossibility!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s witchcraft, Jack,&#8221; she mocked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you change them back?&#8221; he asked a little
anxiously, and she shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but they&#8217;ll change of themselves in a day or
two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; commented Dyke Cappeze, looking up
from his book by the table, &#8220;I oughtn&#8217;t to give away
feminine secrets, but it&#8217;s a right simple matter, after
all. She just put some Jimson-weed juice in her eyes
and the trick was done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimson weed,&#8221; echoed the visitor, and the elder
nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you happen to remember your botany, you&#8217;ll
recall that <a name='TC_7'></a><ins title="Was it's">its</ins> longer name is <i>Datura stramonium</i>&mdash;and
it&#8217;s a strong mydriatic. It swells the pupil and
obliterates the iris.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was walking homeward with a low moon overhead
that evening that Spurrier&#8217;s thoughts found time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
to wrestle with other problems than those affecting
himself and Glory. The incident of the black eyes
had at first interested him only because they were <i>her</i>
eyes, but now he thought also of the episode of the
rattlesnakes and the letter from Major Withers.</p>
<p>In his first analysis of what that letter might mean
to him he had decided that his man would be recognizable
by his mismated eyes. He had recalled Sim
Colby&#8217;s black ones while thinking of unusual eyes in
general and had, in passing, set him down as one who
stood alibied.</p>
<p>Now, in the light of this Jimson-weed discovery,
those black eyes took on a new interest. Presumably
it was a trick commonly known in these hills. <i>If</i>
Colby&#8217;s eyes had been so altered&mdash;and they had
seemed unnatural in their tense blackness&mdash;it must
have been with a deliberate and sufficient motive. Sim
Colby was not making his pupils smart and sting as a
matter of vanity. A man resorting to disguises seeks
first to change the most salient notes of his appearance.</p>
<p>Spurrier recalled, with the force of added importance,
the surprised look on Sam Mosebury&#8217;s face when
that genial murderer, upon his arrival, had stifled
some impulse of utterance.</p>
<p>Suspicion of Colby was perhaps far-fetched, but it
took a powerful hold on Spurrier, and one from which
he could not free himself. At all events, he must see
this Sim Colby when Colby did not know he was
coming&mdash;and look at his eyes again.</p>
<p>So he made a second trip across the hills to the head
of Little Quicksand, and for the sake of safeguarding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
against any warning going ahead of him, he spoke to
no one of his intention.</p>
<p>This time he went armed with an automatic pistol
and a very grim purpose. When they met&mdash;if the
mountaineer&#8217;s eyes were no longer black&mdash;he would
probably need both.</p>
<p>But once again the opportunity hound encountered
disappointment. He found a chimney with no smoke
issuing from it and a door barred. The horse had
been taken out of the stable and from many evidences
about the untenanted place he judged that the man
who lived alone there had been absent for several
days.</p>
<p>To make inquiries would be to proclaim his interest
and prejudice his future chances of success, so he
slipped back again as surreptitiously as he had come,
and the determination which he had keyed to the concert
pitch of climax had to be laid by.</p>
<p>At home again he found that the love which he
could neither accept nor conquer was demoralizing his
moral and mental equipoise. He could no longer fix
and hold his attention on the problems of his work.
His spirit was in equinox.</p>
<p>The only solution was to go to Glory and tell her
the truth, for if he let matters run uncontrolled their
momentum would become unmanageable. It was the
simple matter of choosing failure with her or success
without her, and he had at last reached his decision.
It remained only to tell her so.</p>
<p>It had pleased John Spurrier to find a house upon
an isolated site from which he could work unobserved,
while he maintained his careful semblance of idleness.
His nearest neighbor was a mile away as the crow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
flew, and Dyke Cappeze almost two miles. Even the
deep-rutted highroad, itself, lay beyond a gorge which
native parlance called a &#8220;master shut-in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that remoteness pleased his enemies as well.
Former efforts toward his undoing had been balked by
accidents. One must be made that could have no
chance to fail and an isolated setting made for success.
Matters that required deft handling could be
conducted by daylight instead of under a tricky moon.
It was a good spot for a &#8220;rat-killing&#8221; and Spurrier
was to be the rat.</p>
<p>It was well before sunset on a Thursday afternoon
that rifle-armed men, holding to the concealment of
the &#8220;laurel hells,&#8221; began approaching the high place
above and behind Spurrier&#8217;s house. They came from
varying directions and one by one. No one had seen
any gathering, for the plans had been made elsewhere
and the details of liaison perfected in advance. Now
they trickled noiselessly into their designated posts
and slowly drew inward toward the common center
of the house itself.</p>
<p>Spurrier who rode in at mid-afternoon from some
neighborhood mission commented with pleasure upon
the cheery &#8220;Bob Whites&#8221; of the quail whistling back
in the timber.</p>
<p>They were Glory&#8217;s birds, and this winter he would
know better than to shoot them!</p>
<p>But they were not Glory&#8217;s birds. They were not
birds at all, and those pipings came from human
throats, establishing touch as the murder squad advanced
upon him to kill him.</p>
<p>The man opened a package which had come by mail
and drew from its wrappings the portrait of a girl in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
evening dress with a rope of pearls at her throat. Its
silver frame was a counterpart of the one which had
stood on Martin Harrison&#8217;s desk that night when
Spurrier had lifted it and Vivien&#8217;s father had so meaningly
said: &#8220;Make good in this and <i>all</i> your ambitions
can be fulfilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Spurrier set the framed picture on the table
at the center of the room and it seemed to look out
from that point of vantage with the amused indulgence
of well-bred condescension upon the Spartan simplicity
of his house&mdash;the rough table and hickory-withed
chairs, the cot spread with its gray army
blanket.</p>
<p>The man gave back to the pictured glance as little
fire of eagerness as was given out from it.</p>
<p>Just now Vivien seemed to him the deity and personification
of a creed that was growing hateful, yet
one to which he stood still bound. He was like the
priest whose vows are irrevocable but whose faith in
his dogma has died, and to himself he murmured ironically,
&#8220;&#8216;The idols are broke in the temple of Baal&#8217;&mdash;and
yet I&#8217;ve got to go on bending the knee to the
debris!&#8221;</p>
<p>But when he turned on his heel and looked through
the door his face brightened, for there, coming over the
short-cut between Aunt Erie Toppit&#8217;s and her own
home, was Glory, carrying a basket over which was
tied a bit of jute sacking.</p>
<p>She came on lightly and halted outside his threshold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not comin&#8217; visitin&#8217; you, Mr. John Spurrier,&#8221;
she announced gravely despite the twinkle in her eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m bent on a more seemly matter, but I&#8217;m crossin&#8217;
your property an&#8217; I hope you&#8217;ll forgive the trespass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since it&#8217;s you,&#8221; he acceded in the same mock seriousness,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll grant you the right of way. You paid
the toll when you let me have a glimpse of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is your house,&#8221; she went on musingly.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ve never seen inside its door. It seems strange,
somehow, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier laughed. &#8220;Now that you&#8217;re here,&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;you might as well hold an inspection. It&#8217;s
daylight and we can dispense with a chaperon for ten
minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded and laughed too. &#8220;I guess the granny-folk
would go tongue wagging if they found it out.
Anyhow, I&#8217;m going to peek in for just a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped lightly up to the threshold and looked
inside, and the slanting shaft from the window fell
full on the new photograph of Vivien Martin, so that
it stood out in the dim interior emphasized by the
flash of its silver frame.</p>
<p>Glory went over and studied the face with a somewhat
cryptic expression, but she made no comment
and at the door she announced:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be goin&#8217; on. You can have three guesses what
I&#8217;ve got in this basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Spurrier, catching sight of a bronze tail-quill
glinting between the bars of the container, spoke with
prompt certainty.</p>
<p>&#8220;One guess will be enough. It&#8217;s one of those carrier
pigeons that Uncle Jimmy Litchfield gave you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You peeped before you guessed,&#8221; she accused.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave it with Aunt Erie and let her take
it to Carnettsville with her to-morrow and set it free.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Compare your watches,&#8221; advised the man, &#8220;and
get her to note the time when she opens the basket.
Then you can time the flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory shook her head and laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t own
any watch,&#8221; she reminded him. &#8220;And even if I did I
misdoubt if Aunt Erie would have anything to compare
it with&mdash;unless she carried her alarm clock along
with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; admonished the man, as he loosened
the strap of his wrist watch, &#8220;I&#8217;ve two as it happens&mdash;and
a clock besides. You keep this one and
give Aunt Erie my other. I&#8217;ll get it for you and set it
so that they&#8217;ll be together to the second.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wheeled then and went into the room at the
back and for a few minutes, bachelor-like he rummaged
and searched for the time-piece upon which he
had supposed he could lay his fingers in the dark.</p>
<p>Yet Spurrier&#8217;s thought was not wholly and singly
upon the adventure of timing the flight of a carrier
pigeon. In it there lurked a sense of half-guilty uneasiness,
which would have been lighter had Glory
asked some question when she gazed on the picture
which sat in a seeming place of honor at the center of
his room. Her silence on the subject had seemed
casual and unimportant, yet his intuition told him
that had it been genuinely so, she would have demanded
with child-like interest to be told who the
woman might be with the high tilted chin and the rope
of pearls on her throat. The taciturnity had sprung,
he fancied, less from indifference than from a fear
of questioning, and when he came quietly to the door,
he stood there for a moment, then drew back where
he would not be so plainly visible.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>For Glory had returned to the table and stood with
her eyes riveted on the framed portrait. Unconscious
of being observed her face was no longer guarded of
betrayal, and in the swift expressiveness of her delicate
features the man read a gamut and vortex of emotion
as eloquent as words. The jealousy which her
pride sought to veto, the doubt which her faith strove
to deny, the realization of her own self-confessed inferiority
in parallel with this woman&#8217;s aristocratic
poise and cynical smile, flitted in succession across the
face of the mountain girl and declared themselves in
her eyes.</p>
<p>For an instant the small hands clenched and the
lips stirred and the pupils blazed with hot fires, so that
the man could almost read the words that she shaped
without sound: &#8220;He&#8217;s mine&mdash;he ain&#8217;t your&#8217;n&mdash;an&#8217; I
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter give him up ter ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier remembered how she had declared she
would almost rather see him die than surrender him to
another girl.</p>
<p>Then out of the face the passion faded and the deep
eyes widened to a suffering like that of despair. The
sweetly curved lips drooped in an ineffable wistfulness
and the smooth throat worked spasmodically, while
the hands went up and covered the face.</p>
<p>Spurrier drew back into the room into which Glory
could not see, and then in warning of his coming
spoke aloud in a matter-of-fact voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found
it,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;It was hiding out from me&mdash;that
watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>When, after that preface, he came back, Glory was
standing again in the doorway and as she turned, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
presented a face from which had been banished the
storm of her recent agitation.</p>
<p>He handed her the watch which she took with a
steady hand, and a brief but cheery, &#8220;Farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she started away Spurrier braced himself with a
strong effort and inquired: &#8220;Glory, didn&#8217;t you have
any question to ask me&mdash;about the girl&mdash;in the
frame?&#8221;</p>
<p>She halted in the path and stood looking down. Her
lowered lids hid her eyes, but he thought her cheeks
paled a shade. Then she shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless it&#8217;s something&mdash;you want to tell&mdash;without
my asking,&#8221; she announced steadfastly.</p>
<p>For over a week he had struggled to bring himself
to his confession and had failed. Now a sudden impulse
assured him that it would never be easier; that
every delay would make it harder and blacken him
with a heavier seeming of treason. Vivien&#8217;s portrait
served as a fortuitous cue, and he must avail himself
of it.</p>
<p>This was the logical time and place, when silence
would be only an unuttered lie and when procrastination
would strip him of even his residue of self-respect.
To wait for an easy occasion was to hope for
the impossible and to act with as craven a spirit as
to falter when the bugle sounded a charge.</p>
<p>Yet he remained so long silent that Glory, looking
up and reading the hard-wrung misery on his face and
the stiff movement of the lips that made nothing of
their efforts, knew, in advance, the tenor of the unspoken
message.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes as if to shut out some sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
glare too painful to be borne, and then in a quietly
courageous voice she helped him out.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>do</i> want to tell me, Jack. You want to take
back&mdash;what you said&mdash;over there&mdash;don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier moistened his lips, with his tongue. &#8220;God
knows,&#8221; he burst out vehemently, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
take back one syllable of what I said&mdash;about loving
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come inside, please,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went stumblingly ahead of her and set a chair
beside the table and then he leaned toward her and
sought for words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you, Glory,&#8221; he fervently declared. &#8220;I love
you as I didn&#8217;t suppose I could love any one. To me
you are music and starlight&mdash;but I guess I&#8217;m almost
engaged to her.&#8221; He jerked his head rebelliously toward
the portrait.</p>
<p>Glory was numb except for a dull, very present
ache that started in her heart and filled her to her
finger tips, and she made no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father,&#8221; Spurrier forced himself on, &#8220;is a
great financier. I&#8217;m his man. I&#8217;m a little cog in a big
machine. It&#8217;s been practically understood that I was
to become his son-in-law&mdash;his successor. I&#8217;m too deep
in, to pull out. It&#8217;s like a soldier in the thick of a
campaign. I&#8217;ve got to go through.&#8221;</p>
<p>That seemed an easier and kinder thing to say than
that she herself was not qualified for full admittance
into the world of his larger life.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew this&mdash;the other day&mdash;as well as now,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
she reminded him, speaking in a stunned voice, yet
without anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;So help me God, Glory&mdash;I had forgotten&mdash;everything
but&mdash;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; she half whispered in a dulled monotone,
&#8220;you remember all the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat there with the basket on the puncheon floor
at her feet, and her fingers twisted themselves tautly
together. Her lips, parted and drooping, gave her
delicate face a stamp of dumb suffering, and Spurrier&#8217;s
arms ached to go comfortingly around her, but
he held himself rigid while the silence lengthened.
The old clock on the mantel ticked clamorously and
outside the calls of the bobwhites seemed to grow
louder and nearer until, half-consciously, Spurrier
noted their insistence.</p>
<p>Then faintly, Glory said: &#8220;You didn&#8217;t make me
any promise. If you had&mdash;I&#8217;d give it back to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose unsteadily and stood gathering her
strength, and Spurrier, struggling against the impulse
which assailed him like a madness to throw down the
whole structure of his past and designed future and
sweep her into his arms, stood with a metal-like rigidity
of posture.</p>
<p>Whatever his ultimate decision might be, he kept
telling himself, no decision reached by surrender to
such tidal emotion at a moment of equinox could be
trusted. Glory herself would not trust it long.</p>
<p>So while the room remained voiceless and the minds
of the man and the girl were rocking in the swirl of
their feelings, the physical senses themselves seemed,
instead of inert, preternaturally keen&mdash;and something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
came to Spurrier&#8217;s ears which forced its way to his
attention through the barrier of his abstraction.</p>
<p>Never had the calls of the quail been so frequent
and incessant before, but this sound was different, as
though some one in the nearby tangle had stumbled and
in the effort to catch himself had caught and shaken
the leafage.</p>
<p>So the man went to the door and stood looking out.</p>
<p>For a moment he remained there framed and exposed
as if painted upon a target, and&mdash;so close that
they seemed to come together&mdash;two rifles spoke, and
two bullets came whining into the house. One imbedded
itself with a soggy thud in the squared logs
of the rear wall but one, more viciously directed by
the chances of its course, struck full in the center of
the glass that covered the pictured face of Vivien
Harrison and sent the portrait clattering and shattered
to the floor.</p>
<p>In an instant Spurrier had leaped back, once more
miraculously saved, and slammed the door, but while
he was dropping the stanch bar into its sockets, a crash
of glass and fresh roars from another direction told
him that he was also being fired upon through the
window. That meant that the house was surrounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are they, Jack?&#8221; gasped the girl, shocked by
that unwarned fusillade into momentary forgetfulness
of everything, except that her lover was beset by
enemies, and the man who was reaching for his rifle,
and whose eyes had hardened into points of flint,
shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever they are,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;they want me&mdash;only
me&mdash;but it would be death for you to go out
through the door.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>He drew her to a shadowed corner out of line with
both door and window, and seized her passionately in
his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&mdash;can&#8217;t have each other&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he declared
tensely, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want life. You said you&#8217;d almost
rather see me killed than lose me to another woman.
Now, listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Holding her close to his breast, he drew a deep
breath and his narrowed eyes softened into something
like contentment.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you tried to go out first, you&#8217;d die before they
recognized you. They think I&#8217;m alone here and they&#8217;ll
shoot at the first movement. But if <i>I</i> go out first and
fight as long as I can then they&#8217;ll be satisfied and the
way will be clear for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She threw back her head and her hysterical laugh
was scornful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear for me after <i>you&#8217;re</i> dead!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Hev ye got two guns? We&#8217;ll both go out alive or
else neither one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then suddenly she drew away from him, and he
saw her hurriedly scribbling on a scrap of paper. Outside
it was quiet again.</p>
<p>Glory folded the small sheet and took the pigeon
from its basket and then, for the first time, Spurrier,
who had forgotten the bird, divined her intent.</p>
<p>He was busying himself with laying out cartridges,
and preparing for a siege, and when he looked up
again she stood with the bird against her cheek, just
as she had held the dead quail on that first day.</p>
<p>But before he could interfere she had drawn near
the window and he saw that to reach the broken pane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
and liberate the pigeon she must, for a moment, stand
exposed.</p>
<p>He leaped for her with a shout of warning, but she
had straightened and thrust the bird out, and then to
the accompaniment of a horrible uproar of musketry
that drowned his own outcry he saw her fall back.</p>
<p>Spurrier was instantly on his knees lifting the
drooping head, and as her lids flickered down she
whispered with a pallid smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;The bird&#8217;s free. He&#8217;ll carry word home&mdash;if ye kin
jest hold &#8217;em back fer a spell and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>The window through whose broken pane Glory
had dispatched her feathered messenger could
not be seen into from the exterior. That was
a temporary handicap for the besiegers and one upon
which, in all their forethought, they had not calculated.
It happened that at this hour of the afternoon
the slanting sun struck blindingly upon the glass that
still remained unbroken and confused the ambushed
eyes that raked the place from advantageous points
along the upper slopes.</p>
<p>So when Glory had risen there for an instant,
against the window itself, the vigilant assassins had
been able to make out only the unidentified shadow of
a figure moving there, and upon that figure, at point-blank
range, they had loosed their volley. Whose figure
it was they could not tell, and since they believed
their intended victim to be alone they did not question.
In the confusion of the instant, with the glare on windowpanes,
they missed the spot of light that rose
ph&oelig;nixlike as the pigeon took flight. The frightened
bird mounted skyward unnoted and flustered by the
bellowing of so much gunnery.</p>
<p>But Spurrier&#8217;s shout of horror was heard by the besiegers
and misinterpreted as a cry wrung from him
under a mortal wound.</p>
<p>The assailants had not seen nor suspected Glory&#8217;s approach
because she had come from the front, and had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
arrived before they, drawing in from the rear and
sides, had reached their stations commanding a complete
outlook. They had assumed their victim to be
in solitary possession and now they also assumed him
to be helpless&mdash;perhaps already dead.</p>
<p>Yet they waited, following long-revered precepts
of wariness, before going onward across the open
stretch of the dooryard for an ultimate investigation.
He might die slowly&mdash;and hard. He might have left
in him enough fight to take a vengeful toll of the oncoming
attackers&mdash;and they could afford to make haste
slowly.</p>
<p>So they settled down in their several hiding places
and remained as inconspicuous as grass burrowing
field mice. The forest cathedral which they defiled
seemed lifeless in the hushed stillness of the afternoon
as the sun rode down toward its setting.</p>
<p>John Spurrier, inside the house, living where he was
supposed to be dead, at first made no sound that carried
out to them across the little interval of space.</p>
<p>He was kneeling on the floor with the girl&#8217;s head
cradled on his knees and in his throat sounded only
smothering gasps of inarticulate despair. These low
utterances were animal-like and wrung him with the
agonies of heartbreak. He thought that she must have
died just after the whisper and the smile with which
she had announced her success in her effort to save
him.</p>
<p>Kneeling there with the bright head inert on his
corduroy-clad knee, he fancied that the smile still
lingered on her lips even after she had laid down her
life for him five minutes from the time he had forsworn
her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>Now that she was gone and he about to go, he could
recognize her as a serene and splendid star shining
briefly above the lurid shoddiness of his own grasping
life&mdash;and the star had set.</p>
<p>At first a profoundly stunned and torpid feeling
held him numb; a blunt agony of loss and guilt, but
slowly out of that wretched paralysis emerged another
thought. He was helpless to bring her back and that
futility would drive him mad unless out of it could
come some motive of action.</p>
<p>She was not only dead, but dead by the hands of
murderers who had come after him&mdash;and all that remained
was the effort to avenge her. Like waters
moving slowly at first but swelling into freshet power,
wrath and insatiable thirst for vengeance swept him
to a sort of madness.</p>
<p>Here he was kneeling over the unstirring woman he
had loved while out there were the murder hirelings
who had brought about the tragedy. Her closed and
unaccusing eyes, exhorting him as passionate utterances
could not have done, incited him to a frenzy.
At least some of these culprits must go unshriven, and
by his own hand to the death that inevitably awaited
himself.</p>
<p>And as Spurrier&#8217;s flux of molten emotions seethed
about that determination a solidifying transition came
over him and his brain cleared of the blind spots of
fury into the coherency of a plan.</p>
<p>Out there they would wait for a while to test the
completeness of their success. If he gave way to his
passion and challenged them as inclination clamored
to do, they would dispatch him at leisure.</p>
<p>Just now he was willing enough to die, but entirely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
unwilling to die alone. He craved company and a red
journey for that final crossing. So once more he
looked down into the face on which there was no stir
of animation, then very gently bent and kissed the
quiet lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you could come back to me,&#8221; he chokingly
whispered, &#8220;I&#8217;d unsay everything, except that I love
you. But if there&#8217;s a meeting place beyond, I&#8217;ll join
you soon&mdash;when I&#8217;ve made them pay for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted her tenderly and, through his agitation,
came a sudden realization of how light she was as
he laid her gently on his army cot. After that he
picked up his rifle and bulged out his pockets with
cartridges.</p>
<p>The cockloft above his room, which was reached
by a ladder, had windows which were really only loopholes
and from there he could better see into the
tangle that sheltered his enemies.</p>
<p>He entertained no vain hope of rescue. He asked
for no deliverance. The story drew to its ending and
he meant to cap it with the one climax to which the
last half hour had left anything of significance. Since
small things become vastly portentous when written
into the margin between life and death, he hoped that
before he died he might recognize the face of at least
one of the men whom he meant to take with him
across the River of Eternity.</p>
<p>So, dedicating himself to that motive, he climbed
the ladder.</p>
<p>Peering out through first one and then the other
of the loopholes of the cockloft, he waited, and it
seemed to him that he waited eternally. He began to
fear that his self-sure attackers would content themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
with an inactive vigil and that after all he was to
be cheated.</p>
<p>The sun was westering. The shadows were elongating.
The sounds through the woods were subtly
changing from the voices of day to those of approaching
night.</p>
<p>Still he waited.</p>
<p>Outside also they were waiting; waiting to make
sure that it was safe to go in and confirm their presumption
that he had fallen.</p>
<p>But when Spurrier had, in a little time as the watch
recorded it, served out his purgatorial sentence, he
sensed a stir in the massed banks of the laurel and
thrust his rifle barrel outward in preparation for welcome.
A moment afterward he saw a hat with a
downturned brim&mdash;a coat with an upturned collar&mdash;a
pair of shoulders that hunched slowly forward with
almost <a name='TC_8'></a><ins title='Was inperceptible'>imperceptible</ins> movement. His mind had become
a calculating machine now, functioning with deliberate
surety.</p>
<p>The unrecognizable figure out there was a hundred
yards away and the rifle he held would bore through
the head under the hat crown at that range as a gimlet
bores through a marked spot on soft pine.</p>
<p>But a single shot would end the show. No one else
would appear and even the dead man would be hauled
back by his heels&mdash;unidentified. He would wait until
he could make his bag of game more worth dying for&mdash;more
worth <i>her</i> dying for!</p>
<p>Other ages seemed to elapse before the butternut
figure showed stretched at length in the tall grass outside
the thicket and a second hat appeared. Still Spurrier
held his fire until three hats were visible and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
first man, having crawled to a tree trunk, had half
risen.</p>
<p>He realized that he could not much longer hold it.
At any moment they might rush the place in force
of numbers, and from more than one side, smothering
his defense&mdash;and once in contact with the walls they
would need only a lighted torch.</p>
<p>So he sighted with target-range precision and fired,
following the initial effort with snap-shots at the second
and third visible heads.</p>
<p>He had the brief satisfaction of seeing the first man
plunge forward, clawing at the earth with hands that
dropped their weapon. He saw the second stumble,
recover himself, stumble again and then start crawling
backward with a disabled, crablike locomotion, while
the third figure turned, unharmed, and ran to cover.
But at the same moment he heard shouts and shots
from the other side which called him instantly to the
opposite loophole and, once there, kept him pumping
his rifle against what appeared to be a charge of confused
figures that he had no leisure to inspect. They,
too, fell back under the vigor of his punishment, and
Spurrier found himself reloading in a silence that had
come as suddenly as the noise of the onrush.</p>
<p>He had shot down two assailants, but both had been
retrieved beyond sight by their confederates, and the
besieged man groaned with a realization of defeated
purpose. The sun was low now and soon it would be
too dark to see. Then the trappers would close in and
take the rat out of the trap. What he failed to do
while daylight lasted, he would never do.</p>
<p>In only one respect did his judgment fail him as he
sought to forecast the immediate future. It seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
him that he had spent hours there in the cockloft,
whereas perhaps thirty minutes had elapsed.</p>
<p>He had been thinking of the pigeon, but had put
aside hope as to succor from that agency. Old Cappeze
was not interested in pigeons. The bird would
go to roost in its dovecote and sit all night with its
head tucked placidly under its wing&mdash;and the plea for
help unread on its leg&mdash;and the lawyer would never
think of looking into the dovecote.</p>
<p>Now, since he had failed and must die unavenged&mdash;for
the wounding of two unidentified enemies failed
of satisfaction&mdash;he must utilize what was left of life
intensively. Once more before he died, he wanted to
see the face of the woman whom he had forsworn;
the woman who was worth infinitely more than the
tawdry regards for which he had given her up.</p>
<p>So he went down the ladder and knelt beside the cot.</p>
<p>He laid his ear close to the bosom and could have
sworn that it fluttered to a half heartbeat.</p>
<p>Suddenly Spurrier closed his hands over his face
and for the first time in years he prayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almighty Father,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;give her back to
me! Give me one other chance&mdash;and exact whatever
price Thy wisdom designates.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>To Toby Austin&#8217;s meager farm, which abutted on
that of Dyke Cappeze, that afternoon had trudged
Bud Hawkins. In all the mountain region thereabout
his name was well known and any man of whom you
had asked information would have told you that Bud
was &#8220;the poorest and the righteousest man that ever
rode circuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Bud was among other things a preacher. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
use his own words, &#8220;I farms some, I heals bodies some,
an&#8217; I gospels some.&#8221; And in each of his avocations he
followed faithfully the lights of his conscience.</p>
<p>His own farm lay a long way off, and now he was
here as a visitor. This afternoon he fared over to
the house of Dyke Cappeze as was his custom when in
that neighborhood. He regarded Cappeze as a
righteous man and a &#8220;wrastler with all evil,&#8221; and he
came bearing the greetings of a brotherhood of effort.</p>
<p>The sun was low when he arrived, and the old
lawyer confessed to a mild anxiety because of Glory&#8217;s
failure to return before the hour which her clean-cut
regularity fixed as the time of starting the supper
preparations.</p>
<p>&#8220;She took a carrier pigeon over to Aunt Erie Toppit&#8217;s,&#8221;
explained Dyke, &#8220;and I looked for her back
before now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sometimes &#8217;lows, Brother Cappeze,&#8221; asserted the
visitor with an enthusiasm of interest, &#8220;thet in these
hyar days of sin when God don&#8217;t show Hisself in signs
an&#8217; miracles no more, erbout ther clostest thing ter a
miracle we&#8217;ve got left, air ther fashion one of them
birds kin go up in ther air from any place ye sots hit
free at an&#8217; foller ther Almighty&#8217;s finger pointin&#8217; home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cappeze told him that there was just now only one
pigeon in the dovecote, where the pair belonged, but
that one he offered to show, and idly be led the way
to the place back above the henroosts.</p>
<p>It is, however, difficult for any man to sink his own
absorptions in those of another, and so it fell about
that on the way Cappeze stopped at the barn he was
building and which was not yet quite complete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother Hawkins,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as we go along I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
to show you the barn I&#8217;ve been planning for years&mdash;and
at last have nearly realized.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the crude, unfinished life of the hills, lean-tos
and even rock ledges are pressed into service as barns,
but the man who has erected an ample and sound structure
for such a purpose, stamps himself as one who
&#8220;has things hung up,&#8221; which is the mountain equivalent
for wealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That barn,&#8221; explained Cappeze, pausing before it
in expansiveness of mood, &#8220;is a thing I&#8217;ve wanted ever
since I moved over here. A good barn stands for a
farm run without sloven make-shift&mdash;and that one
cost me well-nigh as much money as my dwelling
house. I reckon it sounds foolish, but to me that
building means a dream come true after long waiting.
I&#8217;ve skimped myself saving to build it, and it&#8217;s the
apple of my eye. If I saw harm come to it, I almost
think it would hurt me more than to lose the house I
live in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon no harm won&#8217;t come ter hit, Brother Cappeze,&#8221;
reassured the other. &#8220;Yit hit mout be right
foresighted to insure hit erginst fire an&#8217; tempest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will&mdash;when it&#8217;s finished,&#8221; said the
other as he led the way inside, and then as he played
guide, he forgot the pigeons and swelled with the pride
of the builder, while time that meant life and death
went by, so that it was quite a space later that they
emerged again and went on to the destination which
had first called them.</p>
<p>But having arrived there, the elder man halted and
his face shadowed to a disturbed perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s strange,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;One pigeon&#8217;s
inside&mdash;the hen&mdash;and there&#8217;s the cock <i>trying</i> to get in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
It&#8217;s the bird Glory took with her. It must have
gotten away from her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears like ter me,&#8221; volunteered the preacher,
&#8220;hit&#8217;s got some fashion of paper hitched on ter one
leg. Don&#8217;t ye dis&#8217;arn hit, Brother Cappeze?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cappeze started as his eyes confirmed the suggestion.
Hurriedly he ran up the ladder to the resting
plank where the bird crooned and preened itself,
plainly asking for admittance to its closed place of
habitation. Perhaps his excited manner alarmed the
pigeon, which would alight on Glory&#8217;s shoulder without
a qualm, for as the man reached out his hand for
it, it flutteringly eluded him and took again to the air.</p>
<p>But now his curiosity was aroused. Possibly Glory
meant to stay the night at Aunt Erie&#8217;s and had sent
him her announcement in this form. He went for
grain and scattered it, and after repeated efforts succeeded
in capturing the messenger.</p>
<p>But when he loosened the paper and read it his
face went abruptly white and from his lips escaped an
excited &#8220;Great God!&#8221;</p>
<p>He thrust the note into the preacher&#8217;s hand and
rushed indoors, emerging after a few minutes with
eyes wildly lit and a rifle in his hands. Bud Hawkins
understood, for he had read in the interval the scribbled
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stopped at Jack Spurrier&#8217;s house. It&#8217;s surrounded. Men
are shooting at us on all sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dyke Cappeze was the one man to whom Spurrier
had confided both the circumstances of his mysterious
waylaying and the matter of the rattlesnakes and now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
the father was not discounting the peril into which his
daughter had strayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going on ahead, Brother Hawkins,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;I want you to send out a general alarm and
to follow me with all the armed men you can round
up.&#8221; There he halted in momentary bewilderment. In
that sparsely peopled territory the hurried mustering
of an adequate force on such short order was in itself
almost an impossibility. There were no means of communication.
Abruptly, the old lawyer wheeled and
pointed a thin and quivering index finger toward his
beloved barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just one way,&#8221; he declared with stoical
directness. &#8220;All my neighbors will come to fight a
fire. I&#8217;ve got to set my own barn to get them here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Five minutes later the structure sent up its black
massed summons of smoke, shot with vermilion, as
the shingles snapped and showed glowingly against the
black background of vapor, even in the brightness of
the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dyke Cappeze himself was on his way, and the
preacher remaining behind was meeting and dispatching
each hurried arrival. As he did so his voice leaped
as it sometimes leaped in the zealot&#8217;s fervor of exhortation,
and he sent the men out into the fight with
rifle and shotgun as trenchantly as he expounded
peace from the pulpit.</p>
<p>When a dozen men had ridden away, scattering
gravel from galloping hoofs, he rode behind the saddle
cantle of the last, for it was not his doctrine to hold
his hand when he sent others into battle. Also he
might be needed there as a minister, a doctor, or both.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>As sunset began to wane to twilight the attackers
who lay circled about Spurrier&#8217;s cabin found themselves
growing restive.</p>
<p>And inside John Spurrier was a man reanimated by
the faint signs of life which he had discovered in
Glory.</p>
<p>A pulse still fluttered in her heart, but it throbbed
flickeringly and its life spark was pallid. Every moment
this malevolent pack held its cordon close was
as surely a moment of strangling her faint chance as
if their fingers had been physically gripping her soft
throat. And he could only kneel futilely beside her
and wait!</p>
<p>From his loopholes upstairs he saw once more two
hats and gave their wearers shot for shot, but when
they kept their rifles popping he suspected their purpose
and dashed across the floor in time to send three
rapidly successive bullets into a little group that had
detached itself from the timber on that side and was
creeping toward the house. One crawling body collapsed
and lay sprawling without motion. Two others
ran back crouching low and were lost to sight.</p>
<p>So he swung pendulumlike from side to side, firing
and changing base, and when his second turn brought
him to the window through which he had shot his
man, he saw that the body had already been removed
from sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>It was a hopeless game and a grim one. He could
not cover all the defenses long in single-handed
effort, and the best he could hope for was to die
in ample companionship. Now, two men had reached
broad-girthed oaks, halfway between thicket and
house. There they were safe for the next rush.</p>
<p>So this was the end of the matter! Spurrier reloaded
his rifle and went down the ladder. Hastily
he carried Glory into the room at the back and overturned
his heavy table to serve as a final barricade.
He elected to die here when they swarmed the door
from which he could no longer keep them, crowning
the battle with a finale of punishment as they crowded
through the breach.</p>
<p>But the minutes dragged with irksome tension. He
was keyed up now, wire-tight, for the finish, and yet
silence fell again and denied him the relief of action.
To Spurrier it was like a long and cruel delay imposed
upon a man standing blindfolded and noosed on the
scaffold trap. Then the quiet was ripped with a
totally wasteful fusillade, as though every attacker
outside were pumping his gun in a contest of speed
rather than effect.</p>
<p>Spurrier smiled grimly. Let them burn their
powder&mdash;he would have his till they massed in front
of his muzzle and the barrier fell.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;When the barrier fell!&#8221; Crouched there behind
the table where he meant to sell his life in that brief
space that seemed long, the words brought with them
the memory of one of the few poems that had ever
meant much to him&mdash;and while he awaited death his
mind seized upon the lines&mdash;a funeral address in
soliloquy!</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;For the journey is done and the summit attained,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And the barriers fall&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>He strained his ears to his listening and then
through his head ran other verses:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;I was ever a fighter, so&mdash;one fight more,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The best and the last!</p>
<p>I would hate that Death bandaged my eyes and forebore</p>
<p class='indent2'>And bade me creep past&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Was that a battering-ram against timber that he
heard? He fingered the trigger.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Then a light, then thy breast,</p>
<p class='indent2'>O thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee again,</p>
<p>And with God be the rest!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>But the door did not fall. The rifle cracking became
interspersed with alarmed outcries of warning
and confusion. He could even hear the brush torn
with the hurried tramping of running feet, and then
the pandemonium abruptly stopped dead, and after
a long period of inheld breath there followed a loud
rapping on the door and a voice of agonized anxiety
shouted:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name open if ye&#8217;re still alive. It&#8217;s Cappeze&mdash;and
friends!&#8221;</p>
<p>The psychological effect of that recognized voice
upon John Spurrier, and of its incredible meaning,
was strange to the point of grotesquerie. Its sound
carried a complete reversal of everything to which his
mind had been focussed with a tensity which had
keyed itself to the acceptance of a violent death, and
with the reversal came reaction. There was no interim
of preparation for the altered aspect of affairs. It
was precisely as though a runaway train furiously
speeding to the overhang of an unbridged chasm had
suddenly begun dashing in the contrary direction with
no shade of lessening velocity, and no grinding of
breaks to a halt between time.</p>
<p>Spurrier had taken no thought of physical strain.
He had not known that he was wearied with nerve
wrack and pell-mell dashing from firing point to firing
point. He knew nothing of the picture he made with
clothing torn from his scrambling rushes up-ladder
and down-ladder and his crouching and shifting
among the rough nail-studded spaces of the cockloft.
Of the face, sweat-reeking and dust-smeared, he had
no realization, but when that voice called out and
he knew that rescuers were clamoring where assassins
had laid siege, the stout knees under him buckled
weakly, and the fingers that had fitted his rifle as
steadily as part of its own metallic mechanism became
so inert that they could scarcely maintain their grip
upon the weapon.</p>
<p>John Spurrier, emotionally stirred and agitated as
he had never been in battle, because of the limp figure
that lay under that roof, stood gulping and struggling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
for a lost voice with which to give back a reply. He
rocked on his feet and then, like a drunken man went
slowly and unsteadily forward to lift the bar of the
door.</p>
<p>When he had thrown it wide the rush of anxious
men halted, backing up instinctively, as their eyes were
confused by the inner murk and their nostrils assailed
by the acrid stench of nitrate, from the vapors of
burnt powder that hung stiflingly between the walls
and ceiling rafters. Old Cappeze was at their front
and when he saw before him the battle begrimed
and drawn visage of the man, he looked wildly beyond
it for the other face that he did not see, and his
voice broke and rose in a high, thin note that was
almost falsetto as he demanded: &#8220;Where is she?
Where&#8217;s Glory?&#8221;</p>
<p>John Spurrier sought to speak but the best he could
do was to indicate with a gesture half appealing and
half despairing to the door of the other room, where
she lay on his army cot. The father crossed its threshold
ahead of him and dropped to his knees there with
agonized eyes, and Bud Hawkins, the preacher and
physician, not sure yet in which capacity he must act,
was bent at his shoulder, while Spurrier exhorted him
with a recovered but tortured voice, &#8220;In God&#8217;s name,
make haste. There&#8217;s only a spark of life left.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the crowd which had followed and stood
massed about the door came a low but unmistakable
smother of fury, as they saw the unmoving figure of
the girl, and those at the edge wheeled and ran outward
again with the summary resoluteness that one
sees in hounds cast off at the start of the chase.</p>
<p>Upon those who remained Brother Hawkins
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
wheeled and swept out his hands in a gesture of imperative
dismissal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave us alone, men,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;I needs
ter work alone hyar&mdash;with ther holp of Almighty
God.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he worked kneeling, tearing away the clothing
over the wounded breast, and while he did so he
prayed with a fervor that was fiercely elemental, yet
abating no whit of his doctor&#8217;s efficiency with his surprisingly
deft hands, while his lips and heart were
those of the religionist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almighty Father in Heaven,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;spare
this hyar child of Thine ef so be Thy wisdom suffers
hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>There he broke off and as though a different man
were speaking, shot over his shoulder the curt command:
&#8220;Fotch me water speedily&mdash;Because Almighty
Father, she&#8217;s done fell a victim of evil men thet fears
Thee not in th&#8217;ar hearts!&#8221;</p>
<p>After a little Brother Hawkins dismissed even the
father and Spurrier from the room and worked on
alone, the voice of his praying sounding over his
activity.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, in a crowded room, Bud Hawkins,
preacher and physician, laid one hand on Spurrier&#8217;s
shoulder and the other on Cappeze&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; he said in a hushed voice, &#8220;I fears me ther
shot thet hit her was a deadener. Yit I kain&#8217;t quite
fathom hit nuther. She&#8217;s back in her rightful senses
ergin&mdash;but she don&#8217;t seem ter <i>want</i> to live, somehow.
She won&#8217;t put for&#8217;ard no effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier wheeled to face them both and his voice
came with tense, gasping earnestness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Before she dies, Brother Hawkins,&#8221; he pleaded,
&#8220;you&#8217;re a minister of the gospel&mdash;I want you to marry
us.&#8221; He wheeled then on the rescuers, who stood
breathing heavily from exertion and fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of you men stay here as wedding witnesses,&#8221;
he commanded. &#8220;One of you ride hell-for-leather to
the nearest telephone and call up Lexington. Have
a man start with bloodhounds on a special train. The
rest of you get into the timber and finecomb it for
some scrap of cloth&mdash;or anything that will give the
dogs a chance when they get here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more Spurrier was the officer in command,
and snappily his hearers sprang to obedience, but when
the place had almost emptied, the three turned and
went into the back room, and, kneeling there beside
the wounded girl, Spurrier whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearest, the preacher has come&mdash;to wed us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory&#8217;s eyes with their deeps of color were startlingly
vivid as they looked out of the pallid face upon
which a little while ago John Spurrier had believed the
white stamp of death to be fixed.</p>
<p>The features themselves, except the eyes, seemed to
have shrunken from weakness into wistful smallness,
and if the girl had returned, in the phrases of the
preacher, &#8220;to her rightful senses&#8221; it had been as one
coming out of a dream who realizes that she wakes to
heartburnings which death had promised to smooth
away.</p>
<p>Now, as the man stretched out his hand to take
hers and drew a ring from his own little finger, the
violet eyes on the rough pillow became transfigured
with a luminous and incredulous happiness. But at
once they clouded again with gravity and pain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>Spurrier was offering to marry her out of pity and
gratitude. He was seeking to pay a debt, and his
authoritative words were spoken from his conscience
and not from his heart.</p>
<p>So the lips stirred in an effort to speak, failed in
that and drooped, and weakly but with determination
Glory shook her head. She had been willing to die for
him. She could not argue with him, but neither would
she accept the perfunctory amends that he now came
proffering.</p>
<p>Spurrier rose, pale, and with a tremor of voice as
he said to the others: &#8220;Please leave us alone&mdash;for a
few moments.&#8221; Then when no one was left in the
room but the girl on the bed and the man on his
knees beside it, he bent forward until his eyes were
close to hers and his words came with a still intensity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory, dearest, though I don&#8217;t deserve it, you&#8217;ve
confessed that you love me. Now I claim the life you
were willing to lay down for me&mdash;and you can&#8217;t
refuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was wistfulness in her smile, but through her
feebleness her resolution stood fast and the movement
of her head was meant for a shake of refusal.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why, dear,&#8221; he argued desperately, &#8220;why do
you deny me when we know there&#8217;s only one wish in
both our hearts?&#8221;</p>
<p>His hands had stolen over one of hers and her
weak fingers stirred caressingly against his own. Her
lips stirred too, without sound, then she lay in a deathlike
quiet for a moment or two summoning strength
for an effort at speech, and he, bending close, caught
the ghost of a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seek payment ... fer what I done.&#8221; A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
gasp caught her breath and silenced her for a little
but she overcame it and finished almost inaudibly.
&#8220;It was ... a free-will gift.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Spurrier rose and sat on the side of the bed.
His voice was electrified by the thrill of his feeling;
a feeling purged of all artificiality by the rough
shoulder touch of death.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m asking another gift, now, Glory; the greatest
gift of all. I&#8217;m asking yourself. Don&#8217;t try to talk&mdash;only
listen to me because I need you desperately. Except
for you they would have killed me to-day&mdash;but
my life&#8217;s not worth saving if I lose you after all.
I&#8217;m two men, dearest, rolled into one&mdash;and one of
those men perhaps doesn&#8217;t deserve much consideration,
but there&#8217;s some good in the other and that good can&#8217;t
prevail without you any more than a plant can grow
without sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>With full realization, he was pitching his whole
argument to the note of his own selfish needs and
wishes, and yet he was guided by a sure insight into
her heart. Brother Hawkins had said she had no
wish to live and would make no fight, and he knew
that he might plead endlessly and in vain unless he
overcame her belief that he was actuated merely by
pity for her. If she could be convinced that it was
genuinely he who needed her more than she needed
him, her woman quality of enveloping in supporting
love the man who leaned on her, would bring consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sought to strengthen myself for success in life,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;by strangling out every human emotion
that stood in the way of material results. I serve men
who sneer at everything on God&#8217;s earth except the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
practical, and I had come to the point where I let those
men shape me and govern even my character.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had been listening with lowered lids and as he
paused, she raised them and smiled wanly, yet without
any sign of yielding to his supplications.</p>
<p>&#8220;The picture that you saw,&#8221; he swept on torrentially,
&#8220;was that of a girl whose father employs me. He&#8217;s a
leader in big affairs and to be his son-in-law meant,
in a business sense, to be raised to royalty. Vivien
is a splendid woman and yet I doubt if either of us
has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he fumbled a bit for his next words and then
floundered on with self-conscious awkwardness, &#8220;has
thought of the other with real sentiment. Until now,
I haven&#8217;t known what real sentiment meant. Until
now I haven&#8217;t appreciated the true values. I discovered
them out there in the road when you came
into my arms&mdash;and into my heart. From now on my
arms will always ache for you&mdash;and my heart will be
empty without you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;,&#8221; Glory&#8217;s eyes were deeper than ever as she
whispered laboriously, &#8220;but if you&#8217;re plighted to
her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; he protested hotly. &#8220;There is no engagement
except a sort of understanding with her
father: a sort of condescending and tacit willingness
on his part to let his successor be his son-in-law as
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lay for a space with the heavy masses of her
hair on the rough pillow framing the pale and exquisite
oval of her face, and her vivid eyes troubled
with the longing to be convinced. Then her lips
shaped themselves in a rather pitiful smile that lifted
them only at one corner.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Maybe ye don&#8217;t ... know it Jack,&#8221; she murmured,
&#8220;but ye&#8217;re jest seekin&#8217; ... ter let me ...
die ... easy in my mind ... and happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before God I am <i>not</i>,&#8221; he vehemently contradicted
her. &#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to give but to take.
Whether you get well or not, Glory, I want to fight
for your life and your love. We&#8217;ve faced death, together.
We&#8217;ve seen things nakedly&mdash;together. For
neither of us can there ever be any true life&mdash;except
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>His breath was coming with the swift intensity that
was almost a sob and, in the eyes that bent over her,
Glory read the hunger that could not be counterfeited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;we&#8217;ve had&mdash;this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier rose at last and called the others back.
He himself did not know when once more he took her
hand and the preacher stood over them, whether her
responses to the services would be affirmative or negative.</p>
<p>To Spurrier marriage had always seemed an opportunity.
It was a thing in which an ambitious man
could no more afford yielding to uncalculating impulses
than in the forming of a major business connection.
Marriage must carry a man upward toward the
peak of his destiny, and his wife must bring as her
dowry, social reënforcements and distinction.</p>
<p>Now, in the darkening room of a log house, with
figures clad in patches and hodden-gray, he held the
hand that was too weak to close responsively upon his
own, and listened to the words of a shaggy-headed
preacher, whose beard was a stubble and whose lips
moved over yellow and fanglike teeth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>Confusedly he heard the questions and his own firm
responses to the simple service of marriage as rendered
by the backwoods preacher, then his heart
seemed to stop and stand as the words were uttered
to which Glory must make her answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you, Glory, have this man, John Spurrier&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>What would her answer be&mdash;assent or negation?</p>
<p>The pause seemed to last interminably as he bent
with supplication in his glance over her, and the breath
came from his lips with an unconscious sibilance, like
escaping steam from a strained boiler, when at last
the head on the pillow gave the ghost of a nod.</p>
<p>Even at that moment there lurked in the back of
his mind, though not admitted as important, the ghost
of realization that he was doing precisely the sort of
thing which, in his own world, would not only unclass
him but make him appear ludicrous as well.</p>
<p>As for that world of lifted eye-brows he felt just
now only a withering contempt and a scalding hatred.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the simple ceremony ended,
Glory sank again into unconsciousness, and the father
and preacher, sitting silent in the next room, were unable
to forget that though there had been a wedding,
they were also awaiting the coming of death.</p>
<p>The night fell with the soft brightness of moon and
stars, and through the tangled woods the searchers
were following hard on the flight of the assailants&mdash;doggedly
and grimly, with the burning indignation of
men bent on vindicating the good name of their people
and community. Yet, so far, the fugitive squad
had succeeded not only in eluding capture or recognition,
but also in carrying with them their wounded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>From Lexington, where Spurrier had formed
strong connections, a deputy sheriff was riding in a
caboose behind a special engine as fast as the roadbeds
would permit. The smokestack trailed a flat line
of hurrying smoke and the whistle screamed startlingly
through the night. At the officer&#8217;s knees, gazing
up at him out of gentle eyes that belied their
profession, crouched two tawny dogs with long ears&mdash;the
bloodhounds that were to start from the cabin
and give voice in the laurel.</p>
<p>Waiting for them was a torn scrap of blue denim
such as rough overalls are made of. It had been found
in a brier patch where some fleeing wearer had snarled
himself.</p>
<p>Yet two days later the deputy returned from his
quest in the timber, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he reported. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done my best, but
it&#8217;s not been good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; inquired Cappeze shortly,
and the officer answered regretfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;This country is zigzagged and criss-crossed with
watercourses&mdash;and water throws the dogs off. The
fugitives probably made their way by wading wherever
they could. The longest run we made was up
toward Wolf Pen Branch.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the direction, Spurrier silently reflected,
of Sim Colby&#8217;s house, but he made no comment.</p>
<p>Brother Hawkins, who was leaving that afternoon,
laid a kindly hand on Spurrier&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s bad news,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I kin give ye better.
I kin almost give ye my gorrantee thet ther
gal&#8217;s goin&#8217; ter come through. Hit&#8217;s <i>wantin&#8217;</i> ter live
thet does hit.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>Spurrier&#8217;s eyes brightened out of the misery that
had dulled them, and as to the failure of the chase he
reassured himself with the thought that the dogs had
started toward Sim Colby&#8217;s house, and that he himself
could finish what they had begun.</p>
<p>Those tawny beasts had coursed at the behest of a
master who was bound by the limitations of the law,
but he, John Spurrier, was his own master and could
deal less formally and more condignly with an enemy
to whom suspicion pointed&mdash;and there was time
enough.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p>And yet on that day when the bobwhites had
sounded and the blow had fallen, Sim Colby
was nowhere near the opportunity hound&#8217;s
house. He sat tippling in a mining town two days&#8217;
journey away, and he had no knowledge of what went
on at home. His companion was ex-Private Severance&mdash;once
his comrade in arms.</p>
<p>The town was one of those places which discredit
the march of industry by the mongrelized character
of its outposts. The wild aloofness of the hills and
valleys was marred there by the shacks of the camp
and its sky soiled by a black reek of coke furnaces.</p>
<p>Filth physical and moral brooded along the unkempt
streets where the foul buzz of swarming flies
sounded over refuse piles, and that spirit of degradation
lay no less upon the unclean tavern, where the
two men who had once worn the uniform sat with a
bottle of cheap whisky between them.</p>
<p>Colby, who had need to maintain his reputation for
probity at home, made an occasional pilgrimage hither
to foregather with his former comrade and loosen the
galling rein of restraint. Just about the time when
the attack on Spurrier&#8217;s house had begun, he had
leaned forward with his elbows on the table, his face
heavy and his eyes inflamed, pursuing some topic of
conversation which had already gained headway.</p>
<p>&#8220;These hyar fellers that seeks ter git rid of Spurrier,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
he confided, &#8220;kinderly hinted &#8217;round thet they&#8217;d
like ter git me ter do ther job for &#8217;em, but I pretended
like I didn&#8217;t onderstand what they war drivin&#8217; at, no
fashion at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t ye hearken ter &#8217;em?&#8221; questioned Severance
practically. &#8220;Hit hain&#8217;t every day a man kin git
paid fer doin&#8217; what he seeks ter do on his own hook.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Colby grinned with a crafty gleam in his eye
and poured another drink.</p>
<p>&#8220;What fer would I risk ther penitenshery ter do a
killin&#8217; fer them fellers when, ef I jest sets still on my
hunkers they&#8217;ll do <i>mine</i> fer me,&#8221; he countered.</p>
<p>For a time after that whatever enemies Spurrier
had seemed to have lost their spirit of eagerness. One
might have presumed that to the rule of amity which
apparently surrounded him, there was no exception&mdash;and
so the mystery remained unsolved. Even blind
Joe Givins made a detour in a journey to stop at Spurrier&#8217;s
house and sing a ballad of his own composition
anent the mysterious siege and to express his indignation
at the &#8220;pizen meanness&#8221; of men who would father
and carry forward such infamies.</p>
<p>And Glory, who had penetrated so deeply into the
shadow that life had seemed ended for her, was recovering.
Into her pale cheeks came a new blossoming
and into the smile of her lips and eyes a new light
that was serene and triumphant. She had been too
happy to die.</p>
<p>While the summer waned and the beauties of autumn
began to kindle, the young wife grew strong, and
her husband, seemingly, had nothing to do except to
wander about the hills with her and discover in her
new charms. Neighborly saws and hammers were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
ringing now as his place was transformed from its
simple condition to the &#8220;hugest log house on seven
creeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In some respects he wished that his factitious indolence
were real, for he felt no pride in the occult fashion
in which he was directing the activities of his
henchmen. And yet a few months ago this progress
would have been food for satisfaction&mdash;almost
triumph.</p>
<p>His plans, as outlined to Martin Harrison were by
no means at a standstill. They were going forward
with an adroit drawing in and knitting together of
scattered strands, and the warp and woof of this
weaving were coming into definite order and pattern.</p>
<p>The dual necessity was: first to slip through a legislature
which was supposedly under the domination of
American Oil and Gas, a charter which should wrest
from that concern the sweet fruits of monopoly, and
secondly, to secure at paltry prices the land options
that would give the prospective pipe line its right of
way.</p>
<p>As this campaign had been originally mapped and
devised it had not been simple, but now it was complicated
by a new and difficult element. In those first
dreams of conquest the native had been no more considered
than the red Indian was considered in the
minds of the new world settlers. Spurrier himself
had brushed lightly aside this aspect of the affair.
Every game has and must have its &#8220;suckers.&#8221; And
their sorry destiny it is to be despoiled. Now the very
term that he had used in his thoughts, brought with
it an amendment. It is not every game that must have
its suckers but every bunco game.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>Martin Harrison did not know it, but his lieutenant
had redrawn his plans, and redrawn them in a
fashion which the chief would have regarded as insubordinate,
impractical and sentimental.</p>
<p>Spurrier intended that when the smoke cleared
from the field upon which the forces of Harrison and
those of Trabue had been embattled, the Harrison
banners should be victoriously afloat and the Trabue
standards dust trailed. But also he intended that the
native land-holders, upon whom both combatants had
looked as mere unfortunate onlookers raked by the
cross fire of opposing artillery, should emerge as real
and substantial gainers.</p>
<p>Of late the man had not escaped the penalty of one
who faces responsibility and wields power. He had
abandoned as puerile his first impulse, after his marriage,
to throw up his whole stewardship to the Wall
Street masters. That would have amounted only to
an ostentation of virtue which would have surrendered
the situation into the merciless hands of A. O.
and G., and would have left the mountain folk unprotected.</p>
<p>Yet he could not escape the realization that he
would stand with all the seeming of a traitor and a
plunderer to any of his simple friends who learned
of his activities&mdash;for as yet he could confide to no one
the plans he was maturing.</p>
<p>It was when the refurnished and enlarged place had
been completed that the neighbors came from valley,
slope, and cove to give their blessing at the housewarming
which was also, belatedly, the &#8220;infaring.&#8221;</p>
<p>That homely, pioneer observance with which the
groom brings home his bride, had not been possible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
after the wedding, but now Aunt Erie Toppitt had
come over and prepared entertainment on a lavish if
homely scale since Glory was not yet well.</p>
<p>To the husband as he stood greeting the guests who
arrived in jeans and hodden-gray, in bright shawls and
calicoes, came the feeling of contrast and unreality,
as though this were all part of some play quaintly and
exaggeratedly staged to reflect a medieval period. In
the drawing rooms of Martin Harrison and his confreres
he had moved through a social atmosphere,
quiet, contained, and reflecting such a life as the
dramatist uses for background in a comedy of manners.
Closing his eyes now he could see himself as
he had been when, starting out for such an entertainment,
he had paused before the cheval glass in his
club bedroom, adding a straightening touch to his
white tie, adjusting the set of his waistcoat and casting
a critical eye over the impeccable black and white
of his evening dress. Here, flannel shirted and booted,
corduroy breeched and tanned brown, he stood by the
door watching the arrival of guests who seemed to
have stepped out of pioneer America or Elizabethan
England. There were women riding mules or tramping
long roads on foot and trailing processions of
children who could not be left at home; men feeling
overdressed and uncomfortable because they had
donned coats and brushed their hats; even wagons
plodding slowly behind yokes of oxen and one man
riding a steer in lieu of a horse!</p>
<p>So they came to give Godspeed to his marriage&mdash;and
they were the only people on God&#8217;s green earth
who thought of him in any terms of regard save that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
regard which sprung from self-interest in his ability
to serve beyond others!</p>
<p>Men who were blood enemies met here as friends,
because his roof covered a zone of common friendship
and under its protection their hatreds could no
more intrude on such a day than could pursuit in the
Middle Ages follow beyond the sanctuary gates of a
cathedral. Inside sounded the minors of the native
fiddlers and the scrape of feet &#8220;running the sets&#8221; of
quaint square dances.</p>
<p>The labors of preparation had been onerous. Aunt
Erie stood at the open door constituting, with Spurrier
and his wife, a &#8220;receiving line&#8221; of three, and her
wrinkled old face bore an affectation of morose exhaustion
as to each guest she made the same declaration:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hopes an&#8217; prays ye all enjoys this hyar party&mdash;Gawd
knows <i>my</i> back&#8217;s broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Spurrier had not in his letters to Harrison mentioned
his marriage, and to Vivien he had not written
at all. He thought they would hardly understand,
and he preferred to make his announcement when he
stood face to face with them, relying on the force
of his own personality to challenge any criticism and
proclaim his own independence of action. Just now
there was no virtue in needlessly antagonizing his
chief.</p>
<p>Among the guests who came to that housewarming
was one chance visitor who was not expected. He
came because the people under whose roof he was
being sheltered, had &#8220;fetched him along,&#8221; and he was
Wharton, the man whose purpose hereabouts had set
gossip winging aforetime.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>It seemed to some of the local visitors that despite
his entire courtesy, Spurrier did not evince any profound
liking for this other &#8220;furriner,&#8221; and since they
had come to accept their host as a trustworthy oracle,
they took the tip and were prepared to dislike Wharton,
too.</p>
<p>That evening, while blind Joe Givins fiddled, and
dancers &#8220;ran their sets&#8221; on the smooth, new floor, a
group of men gathered on the porch outside and
smoked. Among them for a time were both Spurrier
and Wharton.</p>
<p>The latter raised something of a laugh when he
confidently predicted that the oil prosperity, for all
its former collapse and present paralysis, was not
permanently dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world needs oil and there&#8217;s oil here,&#8221; he declared
with unctuous conviction. &#8220;Men who are willing
to gamble on that proposition will win out in the
end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; responded Uncle Jimmy Litchfield, taking
his pipestem from between his teeth and spitting
contemptuously at the earth, &#8220;ye sees, settin&#8217; right
hyar before ye a man that &#8217;lowed he was a millionaire
one time, &#8217;count of this hyar same oil ye&#8217;re discoursin&#8217;
so hopeful about. Thet man&#8217;s me. I&#8217;d been dirt-pore
all my days, oftentimes hurtin&#8217; fer ther plum&#8217; needcessities
of life. I&#8217;m mighty nigh thet pore still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you strike oil in the boom days?&#8221; demanded
Wharton as he bent eagerly forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I owned me a farm, them days, on t&#8217;other side ther
mounting,&#8221; went on the narrator, &#8220;an&#8217; them oil men
came along an&#8217; wanted ter buy ther rights offen me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you sell?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>Uncle Billy chuckled. &#8220;They up an&#8217; offered me a
royalty of one-eighth of ther whole production. They
proved hit up ter me by &#8217;rithmetic an&#8217; algebry how hit
would make me rich over an&#8217; above all avarice&mdash;but
I said no, I wouldn&#8217;t take no eighth. I stud out fer a
<i>sixteenth</i> by crickety!&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Spurrier and Wharton smothered their laughter
as the latter inquired gravely: <a name='TC_9'></a><ins title='Guessed at missing text'>&#8220;Did they play one</ins>
of them royalty games.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They done better&#8217;n thet. They said, &#8216;We&#8217;ll give ye
two sixteenths,&#8217; an&#8217; thet&#8217;s when I &#8217;lowed I was es good
es a Pierpont Morgan. I wouldn&#8217;t nuver hurt fer no
needcessity no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what was the outcome of it all?&#8221; asked Wharton.</p>
<p>Uncle Jimmy&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;The come-uppance
of ther whole blame business war thet a lot of pore
devils what hed done been content with poverty found
hit twice as hard ter go on bein&#8217; pore because they&#8217;d
got to entertainin&#8217; crazy dreams ther same as me.
Any man thet talks oil ter me now&#8217;s got ter buy outright
an&#8217; pay me spot cash. I ain&#8217;t playin&#8217; no more
of them royalty <a name='TC_10'></a><ins title="Was single quote">games.&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fair enough,&#8221; said Wharton. &#8220;But it seems
to me that you people are taking the wrong tack. Because
the boom collapsed once, you are shutting the
door against the possibility of its coming again&mdash;and
it&#8217;s going to come again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man kin git stung once,&#8221; volunteered another
native, &#8220;an&#8217; hit&#8217;s jest tough luck or bewitchment. Ef
he gits stung twicet on ther same trumpery, he ain&#8217;t
no more then a plum&#8217;, daft fool.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>Wharton lighted a fresh cigar and turned toward
Spurrier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Spurrier here, is a man you all know and
trust&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he hazarded. &#8220;I understand that he&#8217;s seen
oil fields in the West and Mexico. I wonder what he
thinks about it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the dark porch Spurrier looked at his visitor for
a few minutes in silence and his first reply was a quiet
question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I tell you I&#8217;d seen oil fields in operation?&#8221; he
inquired, and Wharton stammered a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was under that impression,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Possibly
I am wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;you are right enough,&#8221; answered the other
evenly. &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t remember mentioning it. What
is your question exactly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have a hunch that oil holds a future here and
am willing to back that hunch, don&#8217;t you think I am
acting wisely to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The host sat silent while he seemed to weigh the
question with judicial deliberation, and during the
pause he realized that the little group of men were
waiting intently for his utterance as for the voice of
the Delphic oracle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen oil operation and oil development,&#8221; he
said at last. &#8220;I have lived here for some time and
know the history of the former boom, but I have not
bought a foot of ground. That ought to make my
opinion clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t believe in the future?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, Mr. Wharton,&#8221; inquired Spurrier
coolly and, his listeners thought, with a shaded note
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
of contempt, &#8220;that what I&#8217;ve already said, answers
your question? If I <i>did</i> believe in it, wouldn&#8217;t I be
likely to seek investment at the present stage of land
prices?&#8221;</p>
<p>John Spurrier was glad that it was dark out there.
He knew that the mountain men awaited his judgment
as something carrying the sanction of finality and he
felt like a Judas. He himself knew that back of his
seeming betrayal was a determination to safeguard
their rights, but the whole game of maneuvering and
dissembling was as impossible to play proudly as it
would have been to undertake the duties of a spy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; observed Wharton modestly, &#8220;that if I
lost some money, it wouldn&#8217;t break me&mdash;and I&#8217;m a
stubborn man when I get a hunch. Well, I&#8217;m going
in to watch them dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and went indoors and Uncle Jimmy, when
he put a question acted, in effect, as spokesman for
them all.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does ye think of thet feller, Mr. Spurrier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the opportunity hound crisply, &#8220;that
he&#8217;s a fool, and Scripture says, &#8216;a fool and his money
are soon parted.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ef he seeks ter buy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell&mdash;by all means&mdash;if the price is right!&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day when they were alone Glory said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that man Wharton. He&#8217;s got sneaky
eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her husband laughed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say that he struck
me pleasantly,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;We talked oil out on
the porch. He was the optimist and I the pessimist.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it was to happen that the first rift in Glory&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
lute of happiness was to come out of Wharton&#8217;s
agency, though she did not recognize it as his.</p>
<p>For in these times, despite a happiness that made
her sing through the days, something like the panic
of stage fright was settling over her: a thing yet of
the future, but some day to be faced.</p>
<p>So long as life ran quietly, like the shaded streams
that went down until they made the rivers of the
greater and outer world, she was confident mistress of
her life and had no forebodings. Spurrier loved her
and she worshiped him&mdash;but out there beyond the
ridges, the activities of his larger life were calling&mdash;or
would call. Then they must leave here and she
began to dread the thousand little mistakes and the
humiliations that might come to him because of her
unfamiliarity with that life. Since the bearings of
achievement are delicate, she even feared that she
might throw out of gear and poise the whole machinery
of his success, and in secret Glory was poring over
absurd books on etiquette and deportment. That these
stereotyped instructions would only hamper her own
naturally plastic spirit, she did not know when she
read and reread chapters headed, &#8220;How to Enter a
Drawing-room&#8221; and &#8220;Hints upon Refined Conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>That Spurrier would suggest going without her to
any field into which his work called him, she did not
dream. That he would leave her to wait for him
here, as the companion only of his backwoods hours,
her pride never contemplated.</p>
<p>Yet in the fall Spurrier did just that thing, and to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
the letter which induced its doing was signed the name
of George Wharton. The latter wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We must begin to lay out lines for work with the next
legislature. There are people in Louisville and Lexington
whom you should meet and talk with. I think you had
better make your headquarters at one of the Louisville clubs,
and when you get here I will put you in touch with the
proper bearings.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That much might have puzzled any of the mountaineers
who had taken their own cues from Spurrier&#8217;s
thinly concealed manner of hostility to Wharton,
but the last part of the letter would have explained
that, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The little game down at your house was nothing short
of masterly. Your acting was superb, and though you were
the star, I think I may claim to have played up to you well.
The device of gaining their confidence so that, of their own
accord, they turned to you for counsel&mdash;and then seeming
to gloom on me when I talked oil, was pretty subtle. I
could openly preach buying and instead of turning away
from me in suspicion, they fell on me for a sucker. I&mdash;and
others acting for me&mdash;have, as the result, secured a good
part of the options we need&mdash;and you appear to be of all
men, the least interested.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spurrier read the thing twice, then crushed it savagely
in his clenched hand and cursed under his
breath. &#8220;The damned jackals,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the pack I&#8217;m running with&mdash;or rather I&#8217;m running
with them and against them at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when Spurrier had kissed Glory good-by and
she had waved a smiling farewell, she turned back
into her house and covered her face with her hands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to believe it,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
believe it&mdash;but it looks like he&#8217;s ashamed to take me
with him. Not that I blame him&mdash;only&mdash;only I&#8217;ve
got to make myself over. He&#8217;s <i>got</i> to be proud of
me!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>When he came back for a short stay in the
hills between periods of quiet but strenuous
affairs in Louisville, he brought gifts that delighted
Glory and a devotion that made her forget her
misgivings. She had him back, and he found the
house expressing in many small ways a taste and discrimination
which brought to him a flush of pleasurable
surprise. Glory knew the menace that hung over
Spurrier. She knew of the malevolent and elusive
enmities to which her own life had so nearly become
forfeit, and the old terror of the mountain woman for
her man became the cross that she must carry with
her. Because of her militant father&#8217;s antagonisms
she had been inured from childhood to the taut moment
of suspense that came with every voice raised at
the gate and every knock sounding on the door.</p>
<p>There was an element of possible threat in each
arrival. She had become, as one has need to be, under
such circumstances, somewhat fatalistic as to the old
dangers. Now that the fear embraced her husband as
well as her father, the philosophy which she had cultivated
failed her. Yet their happiness was so strong
that it threw off these things and drew upon the
treasury of the present.</p>
<p>Spurrier, who talked little of his own dangers, was
far from forgetting. His suspicion of Colby strengthened,
and he looked forward to the day as inevitable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
when there must be a reckoning between them, which
would not be a final reckoning unless one of them
died, and for that encounter he went grimly prepared.</p>
<p>One thing puzzled him. Of Sim Colby he had
thought as a somewhat solitary character, whose relations
with his neighbors, though amicable, were yet
rather detached. He had seemed to have few intimates,
yet if he had led this attack, he was palpably
able to muster at his back a considerable force of
men for a desperate project. That meant that the infection
of hatred against himself had spread from a
single enmity to the number, at least, of the men who
had joined in the battle, and it had been a battle in
which more than one had fallen. Before, he had
recognized a single enemy. Henceforth he must acknowledge
plural enmities.</p>
<p>And along that line of reasoning the next step followed
logically.</p>
<p>Who would suggest himself as so natural a leader
for a murder enterprise as Sam Mosebury, whose
record was established in such matters? Certainly if
this suspicion were well-founded it would be safest to
know.</p>
<p>Spurrier, despite all he had heard of Sam Mosebury,
was reluctant to entertain the thought. The
man might be, as Cappeze painted him, the head and
front of an infamously vicious system, yet there was
something engaging and likable about him, which
made it hard to believe that for hire or any motive
not nearly personal he would have conspired to do
murder.</p>
<p>So among the many claims upon Spurrier&#8217;s attention
was the effort to find out where Sam Mosebury
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
stood, and it was while he was thinking of that problem
that he encountered the object of his thoughts in
person. The spot was one distant from his own house.
Indeed it was near Colby&#8217;s cabin&mdash;still apparently
empty&mdash;that the meeting took place.</p>
<p>The opportunity hound had made several trips over
there of late, because he required to know something
of Colby&#8217;s activities, and, of course, when he came
he observed a surreptitious caution which sought to
guard against any hint leaking through to Colby of his
own surveillance. He firmly believed that Sim was
&#8220;hiding out,&#8221; and that despite the seeming emptiness
of his habitation he was not far away.</p>
<p>So it was Spurrier, the law-abiding man, who was
skulking in the laurel while the notorious Mosebury
walked the highway &#8220;upstanding&#8221; and openly&mdash;and
the man in the thicket stooped low to escape discovery.
But his foot slipped in the tangle and a rotting
branch cracked under it, giving out a sound which
brought Mosebury to an abrupt halt with his head
warily raised and his rifle poised. He, too, had enemies
and must walk in caution.</p>
<p>There had been times when Sam&#8217;s life had hinged
on just such trivial things as the snapping of a twig,
and now, peering through the thickets Spurrier saw
a flinty hardness come into his eyes.</p>
<p>Sam stepped quietly but swiftly to the roadside and
sheltered himself behind a rock. He said no word,
but he waited, and Spurrier could feel that his eyes
were boring into his own place of concealment with a
scrutiny that went over it studiously and keenly, foot
by foot.</p>
<p>He hurriedly considered what plan to pursue. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
Mosebury was in league with Colby, to show himself
would be almost as undesirable a thing as to show
himself to Colby direct. Yet if he stayed there with
the guilty seeming of one in hiding, Mosebury would
end by locating him&mdash;and might assume that the hiding
was itself a proof of enmity. He decided to declare
himself so he shouted boldly: &#8220;It&#8217;s John Spurrier,&#8221;
and rose a moment later into view.</p>
<p>Then he came forward, thinking fast, and when the
two met in the road, mendaciously said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it looks queer for a man with a clear conscience
to take to the timber that way, Mr. Mosebury&mdash;but
you may remember that I was recently attacked,
and I don&#8217;t know who did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mosebury nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;d be ther last man ter fault
ye fer thet,&#8221; he concurred. &#8220;I was doin&#8217; nigh erbout
ther same thing myself, but I didn&#8217;t know ye often
fared over this way, Mr. Spurrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s off my beat.&#8221; Spurrier was now lying
fluently in what he fancied was to be a game of wits
with a man who might have led the siege upon his
house. &#8220;I was just going over to Stamp Carter&#8217;s
place. He wanted me to advise him about a property
deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a space Sam stood gravely thoughtful, and
when he spoke his words astonished the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seein&#8217; we <i>hev</i> met up, accidental-like, I&#8217;ve got hit
in head ter tell ye somethin&#8217; deespite hit ain&#8217;t rightly
none of my business.&#8221; Again he paused, and it was
plain that he was laboring under embarrassment, so
Spurrier inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ve done heered ther talk erbout yore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
bein&#8217; attacked. Don&#8217;t ye really suspicion no special
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suspicion is one thing, Mr. Mosebury, and knowledge
is another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thet&#8217;s Bible truth, an&#8217; yit I wouldn&#8217;t marvel
none yore suspicions went over thet-away&mdash;an&#8217; came
up not fur off from hyar.&#8221; He nodded his head toward
Sim Colby&#8217;s house, and Spurrier, who was
steeled to fence, gave no indication of astonishment.
He only inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should Mr. Colby hold a grudge against
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no power of knowin&#8217; thet.&#8221; Mosebury
spoke dryly. &#8220;An&#8217; es I said afore, hit ain&#8217;t none of
my business nohow&mdash;still I does know thet ye&#8217;ve been
over hyar some sev&#8217;ral times, an&#8217; every time ye came,
ye came quietlike es ef ye sought ter see Sim afore
Sim seed <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;ve been here before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, I don&#8217;t think hit. I knows hit. I seed
ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, seed ye. Hit&#8217;s my business to keep a
peeled eye in my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Spurrier&#8217;s careful secrecy had been transparent
after all, and if this man was an ally of Colby&#8217;s, Colby
already shared his knowledge. More than ever Spurrier
felt sure that his suspicions of the man whose eyes
had changed color, were grounded in truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howsomever,&#8221; went on Mosebury quietly, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
nuver drapped no hint ter Sim erbout hit. I ain&#8217;t,
gin&#8217;rally speakin&#8217;, no meddler, but ef so be I kin forewarn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
ye ergainst harm, hit would pleasure me ter do
hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a cordial ring of sincerity in the manner
and voice, which it was hard to doubt, so the other
said gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I did suspect Colby, but I have no
proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether Sim grudges ye or not,&#8221; continued
Mosebury. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t nuver named ther matter
ter me nowise, guise, ner fashion&mdash;but Sim <i>wasn&#8217;t
with ther crowd thet went atter ye</i>. He didn&#8217;t even
know nothin&#8217; erbout hit. Sometimes a man comes to
grief by barkin&#8217; up ther wrong tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again suspicion came to the front. This savored
strongly of an attempt to alibi a confederate, and
Spurrier inquired bluntly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you broached this subject, I think it&#8217;s fair to
ask you another question. You tell me who <i>didn&#8217;t</i>
come. Do you know who <i>did</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Mosebury&#8217;s face remained blank,
then he spoke stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I&#8217;d be glad ter warn ye&mdash;but I didn&#8217;t say
I war willin&#8217; ter name no names. Thet would be
mighty nigh ther same thing es takin&#8217; yore quarrel
onto myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s all you can tell me&mdash;that it wasn&#8217;t
Colby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Spurrier,&#8221; rejoined the mountaineer seriously,
&#8220;ye <i>knows</i> jedgmatically an&#8217; p&#8217;intedly thet ye&#8217;ve
got enemies that means business. I ain&#8217;t nuver
seed a man yet in these hills what belittled a peril sich
as yourn thet didn&#8217;t pay fer hit&mdash;with his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t belittle it, but what can I do?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>Sam Mosebury stood with a gaze that wandered off
over the broken sky line. So grave was his demeanor
that when his words came they carried the shock of inconsistent
absurdity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s a witch woman, thet dwells nigh hyar. Ef
I war in youre stid, I&#8217;d git her ter read ther signs fer
me an&#8217; tell me what I had need guard ergainst most.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; answered Spurrier, repressing his contempt
with difficulty, &#8220;I&#8217;m too skeptical to pin my
faith to signs and omens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the mountain man was looking gravely across
the hills, but for a moment the eyes had flashed
humorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we don&#8217;t need ter cavil over thet, Mr.
Spurrier. I don&#8217;t sot no master store by witchcraft
foolery my ownself. Mebby ye recalls thet oncet I
told ye a leetle story erbout my cat an&#8217; my mockin&#8217;
bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Spurrier began to understand now. &#8220;You
sometimes speak in allegory. But this time I don&#8217;t get
the meaning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waal, hit&#8217;s this fashion. I <i>don&#8217;t</i> know who ther
men war thet tried ter kill ye. Thet&#8217;s God&#8217;s truth,
but I&#8217;ve got my own notions an&#8217; mebby they ain&#8217;t fur
wrong. I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; ter name no names&mdash;but ef so
be ye wants ter talk ter ther witch woman, <i>I&#8217;ll</i> hev
speech with her fust. What comes outen magic
kain&#8217;t hardly make me no enemies&mdash;but mebby hit
<i>mout</i> enable ye ter discern somethin&#8217; thet would profit
ye to a master degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier stood looking into the face of the other
and then impulsively he thrust out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Mosebury,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be honest with you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
I half suspected you&mdash;because I&#8217;d met you at Colby&#8217;s
and I knew you hated Cappeze. I owe you an apology,
and I&#8217;m glad to know I was wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Spurrier,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;ef I <i>hed</i> attempted
yore life I wouldn&#8217;t hev failed, an&#8217;, moreover,
I don&#8217;t hate old Cappeze. Ther man thet wins
out don&#8217;t hev no need ter harbor hatreds. He hates
me because he sought ter penitentiary me&mdash;an&#8217;
failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When shall we go to consult the oracle?&#8221; asked
Spurrier, and Mosebury shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon mebby I mout seem over cautious&mdash;even
timorouslike ter ye, in bein&#8217; so heedful erbout keepin&#8217;
outen sight in this matter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But them thet
knows my record, knows I <i>ain&#8217;t</i>, jest ter say easy
skeered. You go home an&#8217; wait an&#8217; afore long I&#8217;ll
write ye a letter, tellin&#8217; ye when ter go an&#8217; how ter go.
Then ye kin make ther journey by yoreself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks like common sense to me,&#8221; declared the
other, and he went home, forgetting the witch woman
on the way, because of the other and lovelier witchcraft
that he knew awaited him in his own house.</p>
<p>Spurrier, despite his dangers, responsibilities, and
conflict of purposes, was happy. He was happy in a
simpler and less complicated way than he had ever
been before, because his heart was in the ascendancy,
and Glory, he thought, was &#8220;livin&#8217; up to her name.&#8221;</p>
<p>If he could have thrust some other things into the
same dark cupboard of half-contemptuous philosophy
to which he relegated his own dangers, he might have
been even happier. But a mentor who had rarely
troubled him in past years became insistent and audible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
through the silences&mdash;speaking with the voice of conscience.</p>
<p>He remembered telling Vivian Harrison, over the
consommé, that pearls did not make oysters happy
and that these illiterates of the hills might have hidden
wealth in the shells of their isolation and gain
nothing more than the oyster. Indeed, he had thought
of them no more than the pearl fisherman thinks of the
low form of life whose diseased state gives birth to
treasure. They inhabited a terrain over which he and
the forces of American Oil and Gas were to do battle,
and like birds nesting on a battlefield, they must take
their chances.</p>
<p>It was no longer possible to maintain that callous
indifference. These men, to whom he could not, without
disclosing his strategy and defeating his purpose,
tell the truth, had befriended him.</p>
<p>They were human and in many ways lovable. If he
succeeded, they would, upon his own advice, have sold
their birthrights.</p>
<p>However, he gave an anodyne to his conscience with
the thought that if victory came to him there would
be wealth enough for all to share. Having won his
conquest, he could be generous, rendering back as a
gift a part of what should have been theirs by right.
The means of doing this he had worked out but he
could confide to no one. He had embarked as cold
bloodedly as Martin Harrison had ever started on any
of the enterprises that had made him a money baron.
Indeed it had been Spurrier who had fired the chief
with interest in the scheme, and if the thing were
culpable the culpability had been his own. Then he
had come to realize that in the human equation was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
factor that he had ignored: the rights of the ignorant
native. He had fought down that recognition as the
voice of sentimentality until at last he had no longer
been able to fight it down. Between those two states
of mind had been a war of mental agony and conflict,
of doubt, of vacillation. The conclusion had not
been easily reached. Now he meant to carry on the
war he had undertaken unaltered as to its objective of
winning a victory for Harrison over Trabue and the
myrmidons of A. O. and G., but he meant to bring in
that victory in such a guise that the native would
share in the division of the spoils. He knew that
Harrison, if he had an intimation of such an amendment
of plan, would sharply veto it, but when the
thing was done it would be too late to object&mdash;and
meanwhile Spurrier regarded himself no less the trustee
of the mountain-land holder than the servant of
Martin Harrison. He was willing to shoulder, out of
his own stipulated profits, the chief burden of this
division, and in the end he would have driven a better
bargain for his simple friends than they could have
hoped to attain for themselves.</p>
<p>Yet in him was being reborn an element of character,
which had long been repressed.</p>
<p>And there in the other section of the State where
political connections had to be established and the
skids of intrigue greased, much stood waiting to be
done. Already most of what could be accomplished
here on the ground had progressed to a point from
which the end could be seen.</p>
<p>John Spurrier, the seeming idler, could control almost
all the territory needful for his right of way&mdash;all
except a tract belonging to Brother Bud Hawkins,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
cautiously left for the last because he wished to
handle that himself and did not yet wish to appear
in the negotiations.</p>
<p>In the intricate workings of such a project by a
campaign of secrecy, the matter was not only one of
acquiring a certain expanse of a definite sort of property
in a given region, but of acquiring holdings that
commanded the only practicable route through passable
gaps. This special lie and trend of ground he
thought of and spoke of, in his business correspondence,
as &#8220;the neck of the bottle.&#8221; When he held it,
it mattered little who else had liquid in the bottle. It
could come out only through his neck and, therefore,
under his terms. Yet even when that was achieved,
there remained the need of the corkscrew without
which he himself could make no use of his range-wide
jug of crude petroleum. That corkscrew was the
charter to be had from a legislature where American
Oil and Gas was supposed to have sentinels at the
door.</p>
<p>He could not take Glory with him on these trips, because
Glory was of the hills, and loyal to the hills&mdash;and
he could not yet take the natives into his confidence.
For the same reason he could give her only
business reasons of the most general and evasive character
for leaving her behind.</p>
<p>But the work that Spurrier had done so far was
only the primary section of a broader design. What
he had accomplished affected the oil field on the remote
side of Hemlock Mountain, the part of the field
that the earlier boom had never touched, and his
entire project looked to a totality embracing also the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
&#8220;nigh&#8221; side, where his operations still existed only in
projection.</p>
<p>It was while this situation stood that there came
to him one day two letters calling upon him for two
irreconcilable courses of action. One was from Louisville,
urging him to return there at once to busy himself
with political plannings; the other was a rude
scrawl from Sam Mosebury setting an appointment
with the &#8220;witch woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier was reluctant to go to Louisville. It meant
laying aside the little paradise of the present for the
putting on of heavy harness. It necessitated another
excuse to Glory, and more than that, being away from
Glory. Yet that was the bugle call of his mission,
and he fancied that whatever threatened him here in
the hills was a menace of local effect. If that were
true he would not need the warning which the unaccountable
desperado, Sam Mosebury, meant to relay
to him through channels of alleged magic, until he
came back.</p>
<p>Therefore, the witch could wait. But in that detail
Spurrier erred, and when he answered the summons
that called him to town without his occult consultation,
he unwittingly discarded a warning which
he needed there no less than in the hills.</p>
<p>He was called upon to choose a turning without
pause, and he followed his business instincts. It happened
that instinct misled him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>One afternoon Trabue, the unadvertised dictator
of American Oil and Gas, sat with several
of his close subordinates in a conference that
had to do with Martin Harrison, the man he assumed
to ignore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless some unforeseen thing sends oil soaring,&#8221;
ventured Oliver Morris, &#8220;this fellow Spurrier is having
his trouble for his pains. My idea is that he&#8217;s
seeking to tease us into counter activity&mdash;and trail
after us in the profits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if something <i>should</i> send oil soaring,&#8221; crisply
countered Cosgrove, &#8220;he&#8217;d have us distanced with a
runaway start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this man Spurrier?&#8221; demanded Trabue
himself. &#8220;What does our research department report?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a protégé of Martin Harrison&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trabue appeared to find the words illuminating,
and a shrewd irony glinted in his brief smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s Harrison&#8217;s man, he&#8217;s out to knife me&mdash;and
he has resources at his back. Tell me more about
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cosgrove took from his portfolio a neatly typed
memorandum, and read from it aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Former army officer who gained the sobriquet of &#8220;Plunger&#8221;
Spurrier: Court-martialed and convicted upon charge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
murder, and pardoned through efforts of Senator Beverly.
Associated with various enterprises as a general investigator
and initiative expert. Rumor has it that Harrison is grooming
him as his own successor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If his reputation is that of a plunger,&#8221; argued
Morris, &#8220;my guess is that he&#8217;s playing a long-shot
bet for a killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you guess wrong. If Harrison has picked
this fellow to wear his own mantle, the man is more
than a gambling tout. It is only lunacy to underestimate
him or dismiss him with contempt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cosgrove nodded his concurrence and amplified it.
&#8220;In my judgment he&#8217;s something of a genius with a
chrome-nickeled nerve, but he&#8217;s adroit as well as bold.
He has operated only through others and has kept
himself inconspicuous. Except for an accident, we
should have had no warning of his activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he were to get bitten by a rattlesnake,&#8221; growled
Morris savagely, &#8220;it would be a lucky thing for us.
Of course, we might beguile him into our own camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trabue shook his head in a decisive negation.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would only notify him that we recognize his
effort and fear it. If the game&#8217;s big enough, we don&#8217;t
want him.&#8221; He paused, then added with a grim
facetiousness: &#8220;As for your other suggestion, we
have no rattlesnakes in our equipment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dynamic-minded master of strategy sat balancing
a pen-holder on his extended forefinger for a
few moments, then he inquired as if in afterthought:
&#8220;By the way, I feel curious as to how the tip came to
us that this conspiracy was on foot. You say that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
except for an accident we should not have known
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cosgrove smiled. &#8220;It came to this office through
the regular channels of our local agencies&mdash;and I
didn&#8217;t inquire searchingly into the details. I gathered,
though, that the trail was picked up by a sort of
information tout&mdash;a fellow who was hurt and compromised
a damage suit against us. It seems that he
is supposed to be blind&mdash;but he could nonetheless see
well enough to read some memoranda that chanced to
come his way.&#8221; The gentleman cleared his throat almost
apologetically as he added: &#8220;As I remarked I
didn&#8217;t learn the particulars. I merely took the information
for what it might be worth, and set our
men to watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; Trabue made dry acknowledgment. &#8220;And
what is being done toward watching him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand we have a man there who is assuming
an enmity toward us and who is ostensibly helping
Spurrier to build up political influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Trabue once more, with even a shade
more dryness in his voice.</p>
<p>That conversation had taken place quite a long
while before the present, but it set into quiet motion
the wheels of a large and powerful organization.</p>
<p>The knowledge that John Spurrier was objectionable
to A. O. and G. had filtered through to more local,
yet confidential, officials, and through them to &#8220;men in
the field,&#8221; and it is characteristic of such delegations
of authority, that each department suits the case referred
to it to the practical workings of its own environment.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of high business standing in lower
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
Broadway could permit themselves no violence of language,
beyond the intimation that this upstart was a
nuisance. Translated into the more candid brutality
of camp-following parasites in the wildness of the
hills, that mild declaration became: &#8220;The man needs
killin&#8217;. Let&#8217;s git him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Spurrier found that the visit to Louisville
and Lexington, which had promised to be the matter
of weeks, must stretch itself into months, and that
until the convening and adjournment of the assembly
itself, his presence would be as requisite as that of a
ship&#8217;s officer on the bridge. In one respect he was
gratified. American Oil and Gas seemed serenely unsuspicious
of any danger. Vigilance seemed lapsed.
Those men whose duty it was to watch the corporation&#8217;s
interest and to hold in line the needed lawmakers,
appeared to regard legislative protection as a
thing bought and paid for and safe from trespass.</p>
<p>And Spurrier, knowing better, was secretly triumphant,
but without Glory he was far from happy.</p>
<p>Had he known what influences were at work with
cancerlike corrosions upon her loyalty, what food was
nourishing her anxiety, he would have stolen the time
to go to her. Hers was an anxiety which she did not
acknowledge. Even to herself she denied its existence
and against any outside suggestion of inner hurt pride
would have risen in valiant resentment.</p>
<p>But in her heart it talked on in whispers that she
could not hush. At night she would waken suddenly,
wide-eyed with apprehension and seek to reassure herself
by the emphasis of her avowals: &#8220;He&#8217;s <i>not</i>
ashamed of me. He&#8217;s not leaving me because of that!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
He&#8217;s a big man with big business, and some day he&#8217;ll
take me with him, everywhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>When old Cappeze, a man not given to unreflecting
or careless speech, flatly questioned: &#8220;Glory&mdash;why
doesn&#8217;t John ever take you with him?&#8221; she flinched
and fell into exculpations that limped.</p>
<p>The old man was quick to note the pained rawness
of the nerve he had touched, and he began talking of
something else, but when he was alone once more his
old eyes took on that fanatic absorption that came
of his deep love for his daughter, and he shook his
head dubiously over her future.</p>
<p>One day a neighborhood woman came by Glory&#8217;s
house and found her standing at the door. Tassie
Plumford neither claimed nor was credited with powers
of magic, but she, too, might have been called a
&#8220;witch woman.&#8221; In curdled disposition and shrewishness
of tongue, she merited the title.</p>
<p>&#8220;Waal, waal, Glory Cappeze,&#8221; she drawled in her
rasping, nasal voice. &#8220;Yore man hes done built ye a
right monstrous fine house, hyar, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in and see it, Mrs. Plumford,&#8221; invited the
young wife. &#8220;But my name&#8217;s Glory Spurrier now&mdash;not
Cappeze.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the gesture with which the woman drew her
shawl tighter about her lean shoulders, she contrived
to convey the affront of suspicion and disbelief.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I reckon I ain&#8217;t got ther power ter tarry now,&#8221;
she declined. &#8220;I don&#8217;t git much time fer gaddin&#8217;, an&#8217;
be yore name whatsoever hit may, there&#8217;s them hyar-abouts
es &#8217;lows yore man lavishes everything on ye but
his own self. He&#8217;s away from ye most of his time,
albeit I reckon he&#8217;s got car fare aplenty fer two.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>Glory stiffened, and without a word turned her back
on her ungracious visitor. She went into the house
with the tilted chin of one who disdains to answer
insolent slanders, but in the tenderness of her heart
the barb had nonetheless sunk deep. So people were
saying that!</p>
<p>Over at Aunt Erie Toppitt&#8217;s the shrew again halted&mdash;and
there it seemed that she did have time to
&#8220;tarry,&#8221; and roll the morsel of gossip under tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebby she&#8217;s ther furriner&#8217;s lawful wife an&#8217; then
ergin mebby she ain&#8217;t nuthin&#8217; but his woman,&#8221; opined
Tassie Plumford. &#8220;Hit ain&#8217;t none of my business
nohow, but a godly woman hes call ter be heedful
whar she visits at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A godly woman!&#8221; Aunt Erie&#8217;s tone stung like a
hornet attack. &#8220;What has godliness got ter do with
<i>you</i>, anyhow, Tassie Plumford? The records of ther
high cote over at Carnettsville hes got <i>yore</i> record fer
a witness thet swears ter perjury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Plumford trembled with rage but, prudently,
she elected to ignore the reference to her legal status.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef they was rightfully married,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;hit
didn&#8217;t come ter pass twell old man Cappeze diskivered
her alone with him&mdash;in his house&mdash;jest ther two of
&#8217;em&mdash;an&#8217; they wouldn&#8217;t nuver hev <i>been</i> diskivered
savin&#8217; an&#8217; exceptin&#8217; fer ther attack on ther furriner.&#8221;
In the self-satisfaction of one who has scored, she
added: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be farin&#8217; on now, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; don&#8217;t nuver come back,&#8221; stormed Aunt Erie,
whose occasional tantrums were as famous as her
usual good humor. &#8220;Unless ye seeks ter hev ther
dawgs sot on ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the spiteful and forked little tongues of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
gossip were doing their serpent best to poison what
had promised to be an Eden for Glory at home in the
hills, the husband who was charged with neglecting
her was miserable in town.</p>
<p>His work had been the breath of life to him until
now, bringing the zestful delight of prevailing over
stubborn difficulties, and building bridges that should
carry him across to his goal of financial power. Now
he found it a necessity that exiled him from a place
to which he had come half-contemptuously and to
which his converted thoughts turned as the prayers of
the true believer turn toward Mecca.</p>
<p>He who had been urban in habit and taste found
nothing in the city to satisfy him. The smoke-filled
air seemed to stifle him and fill him with a yearning
for the clean, spirited sweep of the winds across the
slopes. He knew that these physical aspects were
trivial things he would have swept aside had they not
stood as emblems for a longing of the heart itself&mdash;a
nostalgia born of his new life and love.</p>
<p>But all the plans that had built one on the other
toward a definite end of making an oil field of the
barren hills were drawing to a focus that could not be
neglected. He could no more leave these things undone
than could his idol Napoleon have abandoned
his headquarters before Austerlitz, and the sitting of
the legislature could not be changed to suit his wishes.
Neither could the lining up of forces that were to
guide his legislation to its passage be left unwatched.</p>
<p>So the absence that he had thought would be brief,
or at worst a series of short trips away from home,
was prolonging itself into a winter in Louisville and
Frankfort. He found himself as warily busy as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
collie herding a panicky flock, and as soon as one
danger was met and averted, a new one called upon
him from a new and unsuspected quarter.</p>
<p>Much of the deviousness of playing underground
politics disgusted him, and yet he knew he would have
regarded it only as an amusing game for high stakes
before his change of heart. But now that it was to be
a battle for the mountain men as well as for Martin
Harrison and for himself, it could be better stomached.</p>
<p>The effort to pick out men who could be trusted in
an enterprise where they had to be bought, was one
which taxed both his insight into human nature and
his self-esteem.</p>
<p>Senator Chew, himself a mountaineer, who had
come from a ragged district to the state assembly and
who seemed to harbor a hatred against A. O. and G.
of utter malevolence, was almost as his other self,
furnishing him with eyes with which to see and ears
with which to hear, and familiarity with all the devious,
unlovely tricks of lobby processes.</p>
<p>But Senator Chew, a countryman, who had capitalized
his shifty wits and hard-won education, bent his
knee to the brazen gods of cupidity and ambition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just see,&#8221; he demurred petulantly to Spurrier,
&#8220;why you go about this thing the way you do.
You&#8217;ve got unlimited capital behind you and yet in
going after these options you ain&#8217;t hardly got hold of
any more land than just enough to let your pipe line
through. You could get all a man&#8217;s property just as
cheap per acre as part of it&mdash;and when I&#8217;ve sweated
blood to give you your charter and you&#8217;ve sweated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
blood to grab your right-of-way, that God-forsaken
land will be a Klondike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; smiled Spurrier, and his ally went
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, but why have nothing out of it except
a pipe-line? Why not have the whole damn business
to split three ways, among Harrison&#8217;s crowd,
yourself&mdash;and the crowd I&#8217;ve got to handle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a mountain man, Senator,&#8221; the opportunity
hound reminded him. &#8220;You know that in every
other section of the hills to which development has
come, the native has reaped only a heart-ache and an
empty belly. I am purposely taking only a part of
each man&#8217;s holding, so that when the oil flows there
what he has left will be worth more to him than all
of it was before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell,&#8221; growled the politician. &#8220;The men you
ought to think about making money for, are the men
you need&mdash;like me, and the men who back you, like
Harrison. These local fellows won&#8217;t thank you, and
in my opinion you&#8217;re a fool, if you&#8217;ll permit me to
talk plain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk as plain as you like, Senator,&#8221; smiled the
other. &#8220;But I think I&#8217;m acting with right sound
sense. Our field can be more profitably developed
among friends than among enemies&mdash;even if no consideration
other than the practical enters into the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not until Christmas time that Spurrier broke
away from his activities in Louisville, and then he
came bearing gifts and with a heart full of eagerness.
He came elated, too, at the fair promise of his prospects,
and confident of victory.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>So Glory hid the fears that had been growing in
her heart and, because of the tidal power of personal
fascination and contact, she found it an easy task.
While Spurrier was with her, those fears seemed to
lose their substance and to stand out as absurdities.
They were delirious miasmas dissipated by the sun and
daylight of companionship.</p>
<p>Spurrier kept most of his valuable papers in a
safety vault in Louisville, but for purposes of reference
here, he maintained a complete system of carbon
copies, and these must be stored in some place where
he could feel sure they were immune from any prying
eye. The entire record of his proceedings would be
clear to any reader of those memoranda.</p>
<p>While Glory was away one day, he removed a section
of the living-room wall and fashioned something
in the nature of a secret cabinet, upon which he could
rely for these purposes. Before he went away again
he shared that secret with her, since in certain exigencies
it might be needful that some one should be
able to act on wired instructions. He showed her the
bit of molding that was removable and which gave
entrance to the hidden recess.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that strong box,&#8221; he told her, &#8220;are papers of
vital importance. If I haven&#8217;t taken you entirely
into my confidence about them all, dear, it&#8217;s because
they concern other people more closely than myself.
All my own affairs are yours&mdash;but in the service of
others, I must obey instructions and those instructions
are rigid.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took out one envelope, though, plainly marked.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is a paper to be used only in case
of extreme emergency. It is an order on the safety-deposit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
people in Louisville to open my vault to the
bearer. In the event of my death, or if I should wire
you from a distance, I would want you to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even that admittance into the veiled sanctum of
his business life pleased Glory, and she nodded her
head gravely.</p>
<p>She did not tell him, and he did not guess, that
tongues were wagging in his absence, and that people
said she was good enough only for that part of
his life in which he shed his white collar and his
&#8220;fine manners&#8221; and donned the rougher habiliments
of the backwoods.</p>
<p>Even when she learned that his coming back had
been only to spend the holidays with her and that he
must leave again to be gone for weeks, at least, she
let none of the disquiet that smouldered in her find
an utterance in words.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>On a fine old Blue Grass estate, which exhaled the
elegance and ease of the Old South, lived Colonel
Merriwell, a life-long friend of Dyke Cappeze. In
years long gone he had more than once sought to
have Cappeze transfer his activities to a wider field.
Now, timber interests called him to the mountains,
and though the cold weather had set in, his daughter
chose to come with him. She had heard much of the
strange and retarded life of the mountains, and because
it was so different from the refinements with
which she had always been surrounded, she wanted to
see it.</p>
<p>When they arrived after traveling conditions that
warranted every conception of quaintness, but violated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
every demand of comfort, the girl from the
Bluegrass found Glory a discovery.</p>
<p>At once she recognized that into any drawing-room
this wilderness-bred girl could be safely dropped, and
that even though she stood in a corner, she would
soon become its center.</p>
<p>Helen Merriwell was fascinated by the anomaly of
an inherent aristocracy in an encompassing life which
was almost squalid, and a bond of sympathy sprang
into instant being. The Bluegrass woman knew by
instinct, though through no utterance from the loyal
lips, that the other was lonely, and when Colonel
Merriwell announced his intention of returning home,
the daughter decided to continue her visit and its
companionship.</p>
<p>To Spurrier&#8217;s house, too, during the crisp, clear
weather of late winter came, without announcement
or expectation another visitor. They were two other
visitors to be exact, but one so overshadowed his
companion in importance that the second became
negligible.</p>
<p>At the Carnettsville station the daily train drew up
one morning and uncoupled, on a siding, the first private
car that had ever run over that piece of roadbed.
Its chef and valet gazed superciliously down upon the
assembled loungers, but the two gentlemen who
alighted and gave their names as Martin Harrison
and his secretary, Mr. Spooner, were to all appearances
&#8220;jest ordinary folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory was housecleaning on the day of Harrison&#8217;s
coming, and, in neatly patched gingham and dust-protected
crown, she came nearer seeming the typical
mountain woman than she had for many days before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Her fresh beauty was hard to eclipse, but she was less
presentable than she wished to be when her husband&#8217;s
great patron saw her for the first time and contrasted
her with such women as his own daughter.</p>
<p>When she heard the name, without previous warning,
a sort of panic possessed her and for once she
became tongue-tied and awkward, so that after the
first, Helen Merriwell stepped into the breach and did
the talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Martin Harrison,&#8221; said the great man
with simple cordiality. &#8220;I thought John Spurrier
lived here&mdash;but I seem to be mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;he does live here,&#8221; stammered Glory, catching
the swiftly stifled amazement of the magnate&#8217;s
disapproving eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221; He put the question blankly as if only
politeness prevented a greater vehemence of surprise.
&#8220;But I expected to find a bachelor establishment.
There are ladies here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory fell back a step as if in retreat under attack.
If this statement were true, Spurrier had never acknowledged
her to the employer with whom his relations
were intimately close. In her own eyes, she
stood as one who had lost caste and been repudiated&mdash;and
all self-confidence abandoned her, giving way to
trepidation.</p>
<p>Harrison stood bewilderedly looking at this country
girl who had turned tremulous and pale, and Helen
Merriwell stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t know that Mr. Spurrier was married?&#8221;
she smilingly inquired.</p>
<p>The money baron transferred his glance to her as
his shadowed face lightened into relief. This young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
woman had the poise and ease of his own world, which
made communication facile. If Spurrier had not been
candid with him, at all events he had, perhaps, not
unclassed himself. The other was presumably a local
servant of whom he need think no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Spurrier,&#8221; he answered easily, &#8220;had not mentioned
his marriage, probably because our recent correspondence
has all related to business. However, I
hold it unhandsome of him not to have done so.&#8221;
He paused, then added deferentially: &#8220;Of course, I
am better prepared now to felicitate him&mdash;since I have
seen you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Helen Merriwell laughed and laid a hand on
Glory&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do me too much honor, Mr. Harrison,&#8221; she
assured him. &#8220;<i>This</i> is Mrs. Spurrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financier&#8217;s ingrained politeness for once failed
him. It was not for long, but in the breached instant
he stiffened arrogantly as his eyes went back to Glory,
and betrayed themselves in half-contemptuous hostility.
The lieutenant whom he had chosen as his own
successor in the world of lofty affairs had not only
deceived him but had thrown himself wantonly away
upon a stammering daughter of illiterates!</p>
<p>Martin Harrison bowed again, but this time with a
precise formality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t notify Mr. Spurrier of my coming, since
I felt sure I would find him here,&#8221; he explained briefly,
directing himself pointedly to Helen Merriwell. &#8220;I
am on my way south, so now I&#8217;ll defer seeing him
until another time&mdash;unless you expect him back
shortly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen turned inquiringly to Glory and Glory shook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
her head. The episode, confirming her own anxieties,
had unnerved her steadfast courage into collapse.</p>
<p>Had any warning come to her in advance of the
event her bearing toward this stranger would have
been a different one. The pride that bowed submissively
to no one except in love, would have sustained
her. The natural dignity which was the gift of her
blood would have been the thing that any observer
must have first and last recognized. With a chance to
have shaped her attitude, Glory would have received
Harrison as a Barbarian princess might have met an
ambassador from Rome, but no such chance had been
afforded her and she stood as distraught and as
panicky as a stage-struck child whose speech fails.</p>
<p>She even slid back into the rough-hewn vernacular
that had been so completely banished from her lips
and custom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got ther power ter say,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;when
he&#8217;ll git back. He&#8217;s goin&#8217; ter Frankfort first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll write to him there,&#8221; said the capitalist.</p>
<p>Harrison departed with the stiff dignity of an
affronted sachem, and Helen Merriwell, looking after
him, smiled with amusement for the incident which
she so well understood, until she turned and saw Glory.</p>
<p>The girl had wilted back against the wall and stood
there as if she had been stricken. Her great, violet
eyes were brimming with the spirit of tragedy and
held the despair of one who has blithely returned
home&mdash;to find his house in ruin and ashes.</p>
<p>Glory stole away to her own room, escaping the
embrace of sympathetic arms, as soon as she could.
&#8220;He&#8217;s done denied me ter his friends,&#8221; she told herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
wildly. &#8220;He dast&#8217;n&#8217;t acknowledge me ter fine
folks!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then through the first, torpid misery of hurt pride,
crept a more terrifying thought. Spurrier had been
practically engaged to this man&#8217;s daughter. He had
been diverted from his purpose by motives of pity, and
now that Harrison knew, he might be ruined&mdash;probably
would be ruined. If so disaster would come to
him because of her&mdash;and at last she rose from the
chair where she had dropped down, collapsed, with a
light of new resolution in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m good for,&#8221; she declared tempestuously,
&#8220;he&#8217;s got to be rid of me.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XVIII' id='CHAPTER_XVIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>During the sitting of the legislature John
Spurrier was a sporadic onlooker, and his
agents were as vigilant as sentinels in a danger
zone. The last day of the term drew to a wintry
sunset, and when the clock registered midnight the
body would stand automatically adjourned until gavel
fall two years hence.</p>
<p>Spurrier, outwardly a picture of serenity, but inwardly
tensed for the final issue, sat in the visitors&#8217;
gallery of the Senate chamber. The charter upon
which all his hopes hung as upon a fulcrum was all
but in his grasp. Seemingly the enemy slept on. Presumably
in those last tired hours the authorizing bill
would slip through to passage with the frictionless
ease of well-oiled bearings.</p>
<p>The needed men had been won over. Carping critics
might prate, here and there, of ugly means that
savored of bribery, but that was academic. The
promise of forth-coming victory remained. Methods
may be questionable. Results are not, and Spurrier
was interested in results.</p>
<p>A. O. and G. had corrupted and suborned certain
public servants. He had discovered their practice and
played their own cards to their undoing. His ostensible
clients were perhaps little cleaner-handed than their
adversaries, but certainly, those other clients who did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
not even know themselves to be represented stood with
no stain on their claims.</p>
<p>Those native men and women had not asked him to
safeguard them, and had they been able to see what
he was doing they would have guessed only that, after
winning their faith, he was bent on swindling them.
But Spurrier knew not only the seeming facts but
those which lay beneath and he fought with a definite
sense of stewardship.</p>
<p>First the <i>coup</i> must succeed, since that success was
the foundation of all the rest, and the moment was at
hand.</p>
<p>For this he had slaved, faced dangers and deprived
himself of the contentment of home and the society of
his wife. Now it was about to end in victory.</p>
<p>The enemy had been caught napping, and the victory
would be his. Certainly he had been as fair as
the foe. What now remained was a perfunctory confirmation
by the Senate, and in these final wearied
hours it would slip through easily in the general
wind-up of uncontested affairs.</p>
<p>Spurrier had not slept for two days&mdash;or had slept
little. When this ended he would go to his bed and
lie there in sunken hours of restoration the clock
around&mdash;and after that back to Glory. Already he
carried in his pocket the brief message which he
meant to put upon the wires to Harrison, at the moment
of midnight and success. Characteristically it
read: &#8220;Complete victory. Spurrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now as the clerk droned through the mass of unfinished
matters that burdened the schedule, the
clock stood at ten in the evening, and a spirit of disordered
peevishness proclaimed itself in the chamber.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Seats were vacated. Voices rose in unparliamentary
clamor.</p>
<p>From the desk where a mountain senator sat in
touseled disarray, a flask was drawn and tipped with
scant regard to senatorial dignity. Then the chairman
of the committee which had the steering of Spurrier&#8217;s
affairs arose and handed a paper to the clerk.</p>
<p>Spurrier himself maintained the same unemotional
cast of countenance with which, years before, he had
watched a horse in the stretch battling for more than
he could afford to lose, but Wharton, who sat at his
side, chewed nervously on an unlighted cigar. Sleepy
reporters yawned at the press tables as the clerk droned
out his sing-song, &#8220;An act entitled an act conferring
charter rights upon the Hemlock Pipe Line Company
of Kentucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reading of the measure seemed devoid of interest
or attention. It went forward in confusion,
yet when it was ended the mountain man who had
taken the swig out of his flask, came slowly to his
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. President of the Senate,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;I
want to address a few incongruvial remarks to the
senators in regards to this here proposed measure.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sudden sense of premonition Spurrier found
himself sitting electrically upright.</p>
<p>That man was Senator Chew who had sat in council
with him and advised him; his right hand in action
and his fox-brain in planning, yet now, with every
moment invaluable he was burning up time!</p>
<p>He was a pygmy among small men, and as he
drooled on he seemed to urge no pertinent objection.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
Yet before he had been five minutes on his feet his
intent was clear and his success assured.</p>
<p>Out of the hands of their recognized lieutenants
A. O. and G. had taken the matter of serving them.
Into the hands of this obscure and loutish Solon who
was ostensibly pledged to their enemies, they had
thrust their commission, and now with the clock creeping
forward toward adjournment, he meant to talk
the charter measure to death by holding the floor until
the opportunity for a vote had elapsed.</p>
<p>Tediously and inanely he meandered along, and no
one knew what he was talking about. In extravagant
metaphor and florid simile he indulged himself&mdash;and
the clock worked industriously, an ally not to be
unduly hurried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen of the Senate&mdash;&#8221; he drooled, &#8220;most
of us have been raised in a land that knows little of
the primitive features that make up life with us, and
though it may not at first seem germane or pertinent,
I want you to go with me as your guide, while I try
to make you see the life of those steep counties that
are affected by the measure before you; counties that
lie behind the barriers and sleep the ancient sleep of
the forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>Men yawned while his tediousness spun itself into
a tawdry flow of slow words, but the Honorable Mr.
Chew talked on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many the day, as a lad, have I lain by a rushing
brook,&#8221; he declaimed, &#8220;where the water gushes with
the sparkle of sunlit crystal and watched the deer
come down on gingerly lifted feet to drink his fill.
Now I reckon mighty few of you gentlemen have seen
a deer come down to drink&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>The minute hand of the clock, in comparison with
this windy deliberation seemed to be racing between
the dial characters.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name,&#8221; exclaimed Spurrier, &#8220;isn&#8217;t there
any way to shut that fool up? He&#8217;s ruining us. Get
some of our leaders up here, Wharton. We&#8217;ve got
to stop him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; demanded Wharton with a fallen jaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t give a damn how! Kill him&mdash;buy him.
Anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late,&#8221; responded Wharton grimly. &#8220;He&#8217;s
already bought. We&#8217;ve walked into their trap. We
might as well go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier sent for his whip, but he had come to the
end of his resourcefulness and shook a dejected head.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to shoot him down as he stands
there,&#8221; said the gentleman testily, &#8220;I dare say it
would stop him short. I know no other way. He
is having resort to the senatorial privilege of filibuster.
We have let them slip up on us. A. O. and
G. has outbid you, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how in God&#8217;s name did they get wise?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other laughed grimly. &#8220;Wise?&#8221; he snorted.
&#8220;My guess is that they&#8217;ve been wise all the time and
that hayseed Iscariot has been playing us along for
suckers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Held by a deadly fascination, Spurrier sank back
into his seat. The clock over the speaker&#8217;s desk traveled
once, almost twice around the dial, and yet that
nasal voice wandered on in an endless stream of
grotesque bombast&mdash;talking the charter to a slow
death by strangulation.</p>
<p>Now, reflected Spurrier bitterly, his connection
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
with the enterprise must seem to any eye that viewed
it that only of Harrison&#8217;s jackal and lobbyist, who had
signally failed in his attempt to raid A. O. and G.</p>
<p>To the mountain folk themselves, if the facts ever
percolated into the hills, his seeming would be far
from heroic and with nothing tangible accomplished,
it would do no good to tell them that he had made
his fight with their interests at heart. Such a claim
would only stamp him in the face of contrary evidence
as taking a coward&#8217;s refuge in lies.</p>
<p>Then when it seemed to him that he could no longer
restrain himself, Spurrier heard the gavel fall. It
was a light sound, but it crashed on his brain with
thunders of destruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; declared the presiding officer, &#8220;The
Senate stands adjourned, <i>sine die</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Had John Spurrier gone to see the &#8220;witch woman&#8221;
when Mosebury advised it, his course from that point
on would have brought him to a different ending.</p>
<p>In looking back on that night, he could never quite
remember it with consecutive distinctness. Gaps of
forgetfulness were fitfully shot through with disconnected
scraps of recollection. When events began to
marshal themselves into orderly sequence, the windowpanes
of his hotel room were turning a dirty gray
with the coming of dawn, and he was sitting in a
straight-backed chair. His bed had not been touched.
Back of that lay a chaotic sense of irremediable disaster
and despair.</p>
<p>At last he caught a glimpse of himself in the
mirror, and that picture of disheveled wildness
startled him and brought him back to realization.</p>
<p>Then self-contempt swept in on him. He had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
called a man of iron nerve; a plunger who never
turned a hair under reversals of fortune&mdash;and now he
stood looking through the glass at a broken gambler
with frenzied eyes. It was such a face as one might
see in the circle before the Casino at Monte Carlo&mdash;the
place of suicides.</p>
<p>The man who had seemed to come from nowhere
and who had talked last night with such destructive
volubility, had been a pure shyster. To be outwitted
by such a clown carried the sting of chagrin, quite
apart from the material disaster. Yet into his disordered
thoughts came the realization that the senator
had been only a puppet. His actuating wires had been
pulled by the fingers of A. O. and G. and the men who
sat as overlords of A. O. and G. were only shysters
of a greater caliber. The men whom he, himself,
served were no better. Compared to this backwoods
statesman he, John Spurrier, was as a smooth and
sophisticated confidence man paralleled with a pickpocket.
Ethically, they were cut from the same cloth,
though to differing patterns&mdash;one rustic and the other
urban.</p>
<p>He had been engaged in a tawdry game, for all its
gilding of rich prospects, but in the face of defeat a
man cannot change his colors.</p>
<p>Had he been able to undertake this fight as his own
man and choose his own methods&mdash;changing them as
he grew in stature&mdash;there might have been a man&#8217;s
zest in the game.</p>
<p>Now, less than ever, could he speak open truth to
these simple friends who had trusted him. Now he
must fight out a damaged campaign to the end along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
the lines to which he stood committed, and until the
end there was nothing to say.</p>
<p>Perhaps if he could avert total ruin, he might yet
have opportunity to reclaim the confidence of these
Esaus who had traded for a mess of pottage. Certainly
they had nothing to hope for from the myrmidons
of Trabue.</p>
<p>John Spurrier forced his shoulders back into military
erectness. He compelled his lips into the stiff
and counterfeited curvature of a smile.</p>
<p>Not only had every resource he could muster gone
into the scrapped enterprise, leaving him worse than
bankrupt, but through him Martin Harrison had been
led into the sinking of a fortune.</p>
<p>Harrison would, in all likelihood, be less bitter
about the money loss, than the thought of the triumphant
smile on Trabue&#8217;s thin lips, but it was quite in
the cards that, with his contempt for failure, he
would wash his hands of Spurrier.</p>
<p>That, of course, spelled ruin. The exhibition skater
had gone through the thin ice.</p>
<p>Harrison could, if he chose, do more than dismiss
John Spurrier. He had seen to it that his lieutenant
was bound to his standards by debts he could not pay,
save out of some future enrichment contingent on success.
If he chose to call those loans he would leave
his employee shattered beyond hope of recovery.</p>
<p>But when Spurrier went down to the hotel dining
room at breakfast time, a cold bath and a superhuman
exertion of will power had transformed him. His
bearing was a nice blending of the debonair and the
dignified.</p>
<p>To no eye of observation was there any trace of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
collapse or reversal. He seemed the man who demanded
the best from life and who got it.</p>
<p>At a table not far from his own sat Senator Chew
with a companion whom Spurrier did not know. The
traitor glanced up and his eye met that of the man he
had betrayed, then fell flinching.</p>
<p>Perhaps the mountaineer expected the dining room
to stage such a scene of recrimination and violence as
it had in the past on more than one occasion, for his
crafty face went brick red, then darkened into truculence
as he half pushed back his chair and his hand
swept tentatively toward his hip.</p>
<p>But the plunger had still his pride left, or its remnant,
and it was no part of his plan to stand the self-confessed
and vanquished victim, by any patent demonstration
of wrath. He met the eyes of the politician
who had played on both sides of the same game, and
smiled, and if there was contempt in the expression,
it was recognized only by the man who knew its
cause.</p>
<p>Later he wrote a telegram to Harrison. It was not
the thing he had expected to say, yet in it went no
whine of despair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have suffered a temporary reversal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those were the words that the capitalist read when
the message, after being decoded from its cipher, was
laid on his desk.</p>
<p>Harrison, recently returned from his Southern trip,
thought truculently of that nearby office in which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
Trabue was also receiving telegraphic information,
and he writhed in the wormwood of chagrin.</p>
<p>The curtness of his response scorched the wires:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain in person if you can. Otherwise we separate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So John Spurrier packed his bag and caught the
first train for the mountains. He must say good-by
to Glory, before facing this final ordeal, and he believed
that in that clarifying air he could brace himself
for the encounter that awaited him in New York.</p>
<p>As he turned into the yard of his own house he
paused, and something about his heart tightened until
it unsteadied him. Here alone, in all the world, he
had known what home meant, and in his heart and
veins rose an intoxicating tumult like that of wine.</p>
<p>Back of that emotional wave though lurked a misery
of self-reproach. Glory had made the magic of his
brief happiness, but there was a background, too, of
kindly souls and a ruggedly genuine welcome. He
had learned to know these people and to revise his
first, false views of them. In them dwelt the stout
honesty and real strength of oak and hickory.</p>
<p>First he had striven to plunder them, then sought to
lift the yoke of poverty from their long-bowed shoulders.
In both efforts he had failed.</p>
<p>But had he failed, after all? Certainly he stood
under the black shadow of a major disaster, but had
not others retrieved disasters and made final victory
only the brighter for its contrast with lurid misfortune?</p>
<p>He had been the plunger who seemed strongest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
when he was weakest, and these enduring hills spoke
their message of steadfastness to him as he stood surrounded
by their lofty crests of spruce and pine.</p>
<p>Then he had reached the door and flung it open
and Glory was in his arms, but unaccountably she had
burst into a tempest of tears.</p>
<p>Before he had had time to speak of the necessity
that called him East she was telling of the visit of
Martin Harrison and his indignant departure.</p>
<p>Despite his all-consuming absorption of a moment
before, Spurrier drew away, chilled by that announcement,
and Glory read in his eyes a momentary agony
of apprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name,&#8221; he demanded in a numbed voice,
&#8220;why didn&#8217;t you write me about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said,&#8221; responded the wife simply, &#8220;that <i>he</i>
would write to you at Frankfort. I thought you
knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I should have thought you&#8217;d have spoken of
his coming and going&mdash;like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her head came up with a brief little flash of hurt
pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hadn&#8217;t ever told him&mdash;about me,&#8221; she said,
though without accusation. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to talk to
you about it until you were ready to suggest it. It
might have seemed&mdash;disloyal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier again braced his shoulders. After a moment
he took her in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory, my sweetheart, I&#8217;ve been playing a game
for big stakes. I&#8217;ve had to do some things I didn&#8217;t
relish. I&#8217;ve got to do another now. I&#8217;m summoned
to Harrison&#8217;s office in New York, at once&mdash;and I
have no choice.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>Glory drew away and looked with challenging directness
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose&mdash;you&#8217;ll go alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must. Business affairs are at a crisis, and I need
a free hand. But, God granting me a safe return, it&#8217;s
to be our last separation. I swear that. I am always
wretched without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Always before when disappointment or disquiet had
riffled the deeps of her eyes, it had taken only a word
and a smile from this man to dispel them and bring
back the serenity of content. Her moments of panic
when she had seemed to drop down, down into pits
of foreboding until she had plumbed the depth of
despair, had been moments to which she had surrendered
in his absence and of which he had been
given no hint.</p>
<p>Now with a gravity that was bafflingly unreadable
she stood silent and looked about the room, and the
man&#8217;s eyes followed hers.</p>
<p>Why was it, he almost fiercely demanded of himself,
that this cottage set in remote hills shed about
him a feeling of soul-satisfaction that he had never encountered
in more luxurious places?</p>
<p>Now as he looked at it the thought of leaving it
cramped his heart with a sort of breathless agony.</p>
<p>Yet, of course, there was no question after all.
It was because in everything it was reflection of
Glory&#8217;s own spirit and to him Glory stood for the
only love that had ever been bigger to him than himself.</p>
<p>The simplicity and good taste of the small house,
standing in a land of squalid cabins like a disciple of
quiet elegance among beggars, had been the result
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
of their collaboration. Glory had had the instinct
of artistic perception and true values and he had been
able to guide her from his sybarite experience.</p>
<p>The stone fireplace with its ingle-nook, built by their
own hands from rocks they had selected and gathered
together, seemed to him a beautiful thing. The natural
wood of the paneling, picked out at the saw-mill with
a critical eye for graining and figuration, satisfied the
eye, and the few pictures that he had brought from
the East were all landscapes that meant something to
each of them&mdash;lyric bits of canvas with singing skies.
To every object a memory had attached itself; a
memory that had also a tendril in their hearts.</p>
<p>But now Glory, too, was looking at all these things
as though she as well as himself were leaving them.
There was something of farewell in the glance that
lingered on them and caressed them, as if of leave-taking
and into Spurrier&#8217;s heart crept the intuition
that despite his declaration just made that this should
be their last separation, she was seeing in it a threat
of permanence.</p>
<p>And that was the thought that was chilling Glory&#8217;s
heart and muting the song of happiness which his
coming had awakened. This place which had been
founded with all the promise of home and companionship
was beginning to hold for her the foreboding
of loneliness and something like abandonment. He
knew it only when they were together here, but she
had been in it alone and frightened more than in times
of shared happiness.</p>
<p>And why was this true? Why could it be either
true or necessary unless, as she had told herself in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
panic moments and denied so persistently, she was
a misfit in his broader life and a woman whom he
could enjoy in solitude but dared not trust to comparison
with others?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>At last she turned abruptly away, in order that the
misery which would no longer submit to concealment
might not show itself in her eyes, and
stood looking out of the window.</p>
<p>Spurrier crossed with anxious swiftness and took
her again into his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I have finished this business trip,&#8221; he declared
fervently, &#8220;our separations shall end. They
have been too many and too long&mdash;but I&#8217;ve paid for
them in loneliness, dear. This call, that I&#8217;m answering
now, is unexpected but it&#8217;s imperative and I can&#8217;t
disobey it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned then, slowly and gravely, but with no
lightening of the burdened anxiety in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just that you have to go away, Jack,&#8221; she
told him. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great deal more than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else is there, dearest?&#8221; His question was
intoned with surprise. &#8220;When we are together, I
have nothing else to ask of life. Have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The place has been changed&mdash;mightily changed,&#8221;
she went on musingly as though talking to herself
rather than to him. &#8220;And yet the walls are the same
as they were that day&mdash;when we both thought we
had to die here together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the dearer for that,&#8221; he exclaimed fervently.
&#8220;That was what made us see things truly.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she questioned, then meeting his eyes
steadily she went on as though determined to say
what must be said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you called Brother Hawkins in to marry
us, I was afraid. I was afraid because I thought you
were only doing it out of kindness, and that afterward
you&#8217;d be ashamed of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ashamed of you,&#8221; he echoed with indignant incredulity.
&#8220;In God&#8217;s name how could I be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or if not ashamed of me that you couldn&#8217;t help
knowing that I was&mdash;what I am&mdash;all right here in
the hills but that outside&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were ever afraid of that, it was only because
you were undervaluing yourself. You surely
haven&#8217;t any ghost of such a fear left now.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a little she stood silent again torn between the
loyalty that hesitated to question him and the pride
that was hurt.</p>
<p>Finally she said simply: &#8220;It&#8217;s a bigger fear now.
Unless I&#8217;m unpresentable, why do you&mdash;never take
me anywhere with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>John Spurrier laughed, vastly relieved that the
mountain of her anxiety had resolved itself, as he
thought, into a mole-hill. He could laugh because
he had no suspicion of the chronic soreness of her
heart and his answer was lightly made.</p>
<p>&#8220;These trips have all been in connection with the
sort of business, Glory, that would have meant keeping
me away from you whether you had gone to town
or not. When we travel together&mdash;and I want that
we shall travel a great deal&mdash;I must be free to devote
myself to you. I want to show the world to you
and I want to show you to the world.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>That declaration he fancied ought to resolve her
fears of his being ashamed of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were afraid I&#8217;d seem out of place,&#8221; she
assured him, &#8220;I might be right sorry&mdash;and yet I think
I&#8217;d understand. I&#8217;m not a fool and I know I&#8217;d make
mistakes, but I was raised a lawyer&#8217;s daughter and
I&#8217;ve got a pretty good business head&mdash;yet you&#8217;ve
never told me anything of what this business is that
calls you away. You always treat me as if there
were no use in even trying to make me understand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man no longer laughed. He could not explain
that it was rather because she might understand too
well than not well enough. Even to her, until he was
ready to prove his intent by his actual deeds, it seemed
impossible to give that story without the seeming of
the plunderer of her people.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the time comes that releases me from my
pledge of absolute secrecy, dear,&#8221; he told her earnestly,
&#8220;I mean to tell you all about my business&mdash;and
I think you&#8217;ll approve, then. Now I don&#8217;t talk because
I have no right to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again there was silence, after which Glory said in
a voice of still resolution which he had never heard
from her before:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ignorant and uncultivated, Jack, but to me
marriage is a full partnership&mdash;or it isn&#8217;t anything.
When Mr. Harrison came, I saw for the first time just
how I looked to men like him. I was just &#8216;pore white
trash.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Spurrier broke off and his face
went abruptly white with passion. Had Harrison
been there at that moment he would have stood in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
danger at the hands of his employee, but Glory shook
her head and hastened to quiet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t impolite, Jack. It wasn&#8217;t that&mdash;only
I read in his eyes what he tried to hide. I only told
you that because I wanted you to understand me.
People here say that you give me everything but yourself;
that I&#8217;m not good enough for you except right
here where there&#8217;s nothing better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a damned lie,&#8221; he expostulated. &#8220;Who
says it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only women-folks and gossipy grannies that you
can&#8217;t fight with, Jack,&#8221; she answered steadily. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ve thought about it lots. I&#8217;ve come to think, dear,
that maybe you ought to be free&mdash;and if you ought,&#8221;
she paused, then the final assertion broke from her
with an agonized voice, &#8220;then, I love you enough to
set you free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier seized her in his arms and his words came
choked with vehement feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you, Glory. I want you always and I
couldn&#8217;t live without you. When I have to go away I
endure it only by thinking of coming back to you.
If you ever set me free as you call it, it will be only
because <i>you</i> don&#8217;t want <i>me</i>. I suppose in that case I&#8217;d
try to take my medicine&mdash;but I think it would about
kill me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no danger of that, dear,&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>The man drew away for a moment and fumbled
for words. His aptness of speech had deserted him
and at last he spoke clumsily:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to explain just now, when you&#8217;ve accused
me of not taking you into my confidence, but I stand
at a point, Glory, where I&#8217;ve got the hardest fight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
ahead of me I ever made. I stand to be ruined or to
make good. I&#8217;ve got to use every minute and every
thought in competition with quick brains and enormous
power. Until its over I must be a machine
with one idea ... and I&#8217;ll fail, dear, unless I can
take with me the knowledge that you trust me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up into his face and the misery in her
eyes gave place to confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Jack,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I believe in you and
I&#8217;m not even afraid of your failing.&#8221; After a moment
she clasped her arms tightly about him and
added vehemently: &#8220;But whether you succeed or fail,
come back to me, dear, because, except for your sake,
it won&#8217;t make any difference to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>That same afternoon Spurrier found time to visit
the &#8220;witch woman.&#8221; It had dawned upon him since
that night in the Senate chamber that, after all, Sim
Colby might have been the least dangerous of his
enemies, and the thought made him inquisitive.</p>
<p>The old crone made her magic with abundant grotesquerie,
but at its end she peered shrewdly into his
eyes, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I reads hyar in the omends thet mebby ye comes
too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier smiled grimly. He thought that himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dis&#8217;arns,&#8221; went on the hag portentously, &#8220;thet a
blind man impereled ye mightily&mdash;a blind man thet
plays a fiddle&mdash;but thars others beside him thet dwells
fur away an&#8217; holds a mighty power of wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>A blind man! Spurrier&#8217;s remembrance flashed back
to the visit of blind Joe Givins and the papers incautiously
left on his table. Yet if he was genuinely
blind they could have meant nothing to him&mdash;and if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
he was not genuinely blind it was hard to conceive of
human nerves enduring without wincing that test of
the gun thrust against the temple.</p>
<p>Spurrier rose and paid his fee. Had he seen her
in time, this warning would have averted disaster.
Now it was something of a post-mortem.</p>
<p>At the door of Martin Harrison&#8217;s office several days
later Spurrier drew back his shoulders and braced
himself. It was impossible to ignore the fact that
he stood on the brink of total ruin; that his sole hope
lay in persuading his principal that with more time
and more money he would yet be able to succeed&mdash;and
Harrison was as plastic to persuasion as a brass
Buddha.</p>
<p>But he had steeled himself for the interview&mdash;and
now he turned the knob and swung back the mahogany
door.</p>
<p>Spurrier was familiar enough with the atmosphere
of that office to read the signs correctly. The hushed
air of nervousness that hung over it now betokened a
chief in a mood which no one sought to stir to further
irritation.</p>
<p>Always in the past Spurrier had been deferentially
ushered into a private office and treated as the future
chief. Now, as though he were already a disinherited
heir, he was left in the general waiting room, and he
was left there for an hour. That cooling of the
heel, he recognized as a warning of the cold reception
to come&mdash;and an augury of ruin.</p>
<p>At last he was called in, but he went with an unruffled
demeanor which hid from the principal&#8217;s eye
how near to breaking his inward confidence was
strained.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wired you to come at once,&#8221; began Harrison
curtly, and Spurrier smiled as he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came at once, sir, except that I hadn&#8217;t been
home for some time, and it was necessary to make a
stop there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Home,&#8221; Martin&#8217;s brows lifted a trifle. &#8220;You mean
the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly&mdash;for the time being, I&#8217;m located there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well be honest with each other,&#8221; asserted
the magnate. &#8220;I consider that under the circumstances
you behaved with serious discourtesy and
without candor.&#8221; For a casual moment his glance
dwelt on the portrait of Vivien which stood on his
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I disagree with you, sir. I preferred relating the
full circumstances, which were unusual, when there
was an opportunity to do so in person. I was kept
there by your interests as well as my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That recital,&#8221; said the older man dryly, &#8220;is your
concern. Now that I know the facts I find myself
uninterested in the details. You have chosen your
way. The question is whether we can travel it together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I presume that the first point of that question
demands a full report upon the business
operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I can see, they have collapsed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have by no means collapsed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the wrath that had been smoldering in
Harrison&#8217;s eyes burst into tempest. He brought his
clenched fist down upon his desk until inkwells and
accessories rattled.</p>
<p>This man&#8217;s moments of equinox were terrifying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
those who must bow to his will&mdash;and his will held
sway over broad horizons. If John Spurrier had not
been intrepid he must have collapsed under the withering
violence of the passion that rained on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before God,&#8221; cried Harrison, <a name='TC_13'></a><ins title='Was pacink'>pacing</ins> his floor like
a lion that lashes itself to frenzy, &#8220;you undertook to
avenge me on Trabue. You have drawn on me with
carte-blanche liberties and spent fortunes like a prodigal!
You have assured me that you had, at all times,
the situation well in hand. Then, through some
damned blunder, you failed. Let the money loss slide.
Damn the money! I&#8217;m the laughingstock of the business
world. I&#8217;m delivered over to Trabue&#8217;s enjoyment
as a boob who failed. I&#8217;m an absurdity, and you&#8217;re
responsible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;ve finished, sir,&#8221; said Spurrier quietly,
&#8220;I shall endeavor to show you that none of those
things have happened&mdash;that our failure is temporary
and that when you undertook this enterprise you were
in no impetuous haste as to the time of its accomplishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The legislature doesn&#8217;t meet for two years,&#8221; Harrison
barked back at him. &#8220;That will be two years
of preparation for Trabue. Now he&#8217;s fully warned,
where do we get off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At our original point of destination, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opportunity hound began his argument. His
demeanor of unruffled calm and entire confidence
began to exercise its persuasive force. Harrison
cooled somewhat, but Spurrier was fighting, beneath
his pose, as a man who has cramps in deep water
fights for his life. These few minutes would determine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
his fate, and he was totally at the mercy of
this single arbiter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have now all the options we need on the far
side of Hemlock Mountain,&#8221; Spurrier summarized at
last. &#8220;All except one tract which belongs to Bud
Hawkins, who is a preacher and a friend of mine.
He must have more generous terms, but I will be able
to do business with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk of the options on the far side of the
ridge,&#8221; Harrison broke in belligerently. &#8220;That is the
minor field.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be able to repeat that performance on the near
side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not! A repetition of your performance
is the last thing we crave. Any movement now would
be only a piling up of warnings. For the present you
will give every indication of having abandoned the
project.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my idea, sir. I was not speaking of immediate
but future activities. Also&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; In spite
of his desperation of plight the younger man&#8217;s bearing
flashed into a challenging undernote of its old
audacity, &#8220;when I used the word &#8216;repeat&#8217; I referred
to the successful portion of my effort. There was no
failure on the land end. It was the charter that went
wrong&mdash;through the deceit of a man we had to trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man whom you selected,&#8221; Harrison caught him
up. &#8220;You understood, in advance, the chances of your
game. It was agreed upon your own insistence that
your hand should be absolutely free&mdash;and freedom
of method carries exclusiveness of responsibility.
Traitors exist. They don&#8217;t furnish excuses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor am I making them. I am merely stating facts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
which you seem inclined to confuse. I grant the
failure but I also claim the partial success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrison seated himself, and as the interview
stretched Spurrier&#8217;s nerves stretched with it under the
placid surface of his plunger&#8217;s camouflage. He had,
as yet, no way of guessing how the verdict would go,
and now the capitalist&#8217;s face was hardened in discouragement.
It was a face of merciless inflexibility. The
sentence had been prepared in the judge&#8217;s mind.
There remained only its enunciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is to be gained by mincing my words,
Spurrier,&#8221; declared Spurrier&#8217;s chief. &#8220;We know precisely
where you stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrison extended his hand with its fingers spread
and closed it slowly into a clenched fist. &#8220;I hold
you&mdash;there! I can crush you to a pulp of absolute
ruin. You know that. The only question is whether
I want, or not, to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And whether, or not, you can afford to do it,&#8221;
amended the other with an audacity that he by no
means felt. &#8220;You must decide whether you can afford
to accept tamely and as a final defeat, a mere reversal,
which I&mdash;and no one else&mdash;can turn into eventual
victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have duly considered that. I had implicit confidence
in your abilities. You have struck at my
personal feeling for you by a silence that was not
frank. You have allied yourself with the mountain
people by marriage, and we stand on opposite sides of
the line of interest. You have all the while been
watched by our enemies, and I regard you as a defeated
man. If I choose to cast you aside, you go to
the scrap heap. You will never recover.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>That was an assertion which there was neither
health nor wisdom in contradicting and Spurrier
waited. His last card was played.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am going to cast you aside&mdash;bankrupt you&mdash;ruin
you!&#8221; blazed out Harrison, &#8220;unless you absolutely
meet my requirements during a period of probation.
That period will engage you in a very different matter.
For the present you are through with the Kentucky
mountains. The new task will be a difficult one, and
it should put you on your mettle. It is one that can&#8217;t
be accomplished at all unless you can do it. You have
that one chance to retrieve yourself. Take it or
leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are your terms?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will sail to-morrow for Liverpool. I will give
you explicit instructions to-night. Go prepared for an
extended stay abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time Spurrier&#8217;s face paled and insurrection
flared in his pupils.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sail for Europe to-morrow!&#8221; he exclaimed
vehemently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you damned first! Doesn&#8217;t it
occur to you that a man has his human side? I have
a wife and a home and when I am ordered to leave
them for an indefinite time I&#8217;m entitled to a breathing
space in which to set my own affairs in shape. I am
willing enough to undertake your bidding&mdash;but not
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier paused at the end of his outbreak and
stood looking down at the seated figure, which to
all intents and purposes might have been the god that
held, for him, life and death in his hand.</p>
<p>And as he looked Spurrier thought he had never
seen such glacial coldness and merciless indifference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
in any human face. He had known this man in the
thundering of passion before which the walls about
him seemed to tremble, but this manifestation of adamant
implacability was new, and he realized that he
had invited destruction in defying it.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; replied Harrison crisply, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
to-morrow or not at all. I&#8217;ve already outlined the
alternative and since you refuse, our business seems
concluded. Next time you feel disposed to talk or
think of what you&#8217;re entitled to, remember that my
view is different. All your claims stand forfeit in
my judgment. You are entitled to just what I choose
to offer&mdash;and no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief glanced toward the door with a glance
of dismissal, and the door became to Spurrier the emblem
of finality. Yet he did not at once move toward
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate the need of prompt obedience, where
there is an urge of haste,&#8221; he persisted, &#8220;but if a few
days wouldn&#8217;t imperil results, I want those days to
make a flying trip to Kentucky and to my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The face of the seated man remained obdurately set
but his eyes blazed again with a note of personal anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a time when I was reasonably interested, you
chose to leave me unenlightened about your domestic
arrangements. Now I can claim no concern in
them. Most wives, however, permit their husbands
such latitude of movement as business requires. If
yours does not it is your own misfortune. I think
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier knew that the jaws of the trap were closing
on him. He had been too hasty in his outburst
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
and he turned toward the door, but as his hand fell
on the bronze knob Harrison spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think it over, Spurrier. I can&mdash;and will ruin you&mdash;unless
you yield. It is no time for maudlin sentiment,
but until five-thirty this afternoon, I shall not
consider your answer final. Up to that hour you
may reconsider it, if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will notify you at five,&#8221; responded the lieutenant
as he let himself out and closed the door behind him.</p>
<p>That day the opportunity hound spent in an agony
of conflicting emotions. That the other held a bolt
of destruction and was in the mood to launch it he
did not pretend to doubt. If it were launched even
the land upon which his cottage stood would no longer
be his own. He must either return to Glory empty-handed
and bankrupt, or strain with a new tax, the
confidence he had asked of her, with the pledge that
he would return soon and for good.</p>
<p>But if, even at the cost of humbled pride and Glory&#8217;s
hurt, he maintained his business relations, the path to
eventual success remained open.</p>
<p>As long as the cards were being shuffled chance
beckoned and at five o&#8217;clock Spurrier went into a
cigar-store booth and called a downtown telephone
number.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hold the whip hand, sir,&#8221; he announced curtly
when a secretary had put Harrison on the wire.
&#8220;When do I report for final instructions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to my house this evening,&#8221; ordered the
master.</p>
<p>Most of the hours of that evening, except the two
in Harrison&#8217;s study, Spurrier spent in writing to Glory,
tearing up letter after letter while the nervous moisture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
bedewed his brow. It was so impossible to give
her any true or comprehensive explanation of the
pressing weight of compulsion. His messages must
have the limp of unreason. He was crossing the ocean
without her and she would read into it a sort of
abandonment that would hurt and wound her. He
had taxed everything else in life, and now he was
overtaxing her loyalty.</p>
<p>Yet he believed that if in his depleted treasury of
life there was one thing left upon which he could draw
prodigally and with faith, it was that love; a love
that would stand staunch though he were forced to
hurt it once again.</p>
<p>So Spurrier sailed and, having arrived on European
soil, took up the work that threw him into relations
with men of large caliber in Capel Court and Threadneedle
Street. His mission carried him to the continent
as well; from Paris to Brussels and from Brussels
to Hamburg and Berlin, where the quaint customs
of the Kentucky Cumberlands seemed as remote as
the life of Mars&mdash;remote but, to Spurrier, as alluring
as the thought of salvation to a recluse who has foresworn
the things of earth.</p>
<p>In terms of dead reckoning, Berlin is as far from
Hemlock Mountain as Hemlock Mountain is from
Berlin, but in terms of human relations Glory felt
the distance as infinitely greater than did her husband.
To him the Atlantic was only an ocean three thousand
miles wide; often crossed and discounted by familiarity.
To her it was a measureless waste separating
all she knew from another world. To him continental
dimensions were reckoned in hours of commonplace
railway journeying, but to her the &#8220;measured mile&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
was both lengthwise and perpendicular, and when she
passed old friends she fancied that she detected in
their glances either pity for her desertion or the smirk
of &#8220;I-told-you-so&#8221; malevolence.</p>
<p>It even crept to her ears that &#8220;some folks&#8221; spoke
of her as &#8220;the widder Spurrier&#8221; and that Tassie Plumford
had chuckled, &#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s done gone off an&#8217;
left her fer good an&#8217; all this time. Folks says he&#8217;s
fled away cl&#8217;ar acrost ther ocean-sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory told herself that she had promised faith and
that she was in no danger of faltering, but as the
weeks lengthened into months and the months followed
each other, her waiting became bitter.</p>
<p>In Berlin John Spurrier passed as a British subject,
bearing British passports. That had been part
of the careful plan to prevent discovery of what
American interests he represented and it had proven
effective. He had almost accomplished the difficult
task of self-redemption, set him by the man whose confidence
he had strained.</p>
<p>Then came the bolt out of heaven. The inconceivable
suddenness of the war cloud belched and
broke, but he remained confident that he would have
a chance to finish up before the paralysis cramped
bourse and exchange.</p>
<p>England would not come in, and he, the seeming
British subject, would have safe conduct out of
Germany.</p>
<p>Now he must get back. This would mean the
soaring of oil prices, and along new lines the battle
must be pitched back there at home, before it was too
late.</p>
<p>So Spurrier finished his packing. He was going out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
onto the streets to watch the upflame of the war spirit
and to make railway reservations.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door and the man opened
it. Stiffly erect, stood a squad of military police and
stiffly their lieutenant saluted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Herr John Spurrier?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>The man nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, perhaps, in the nature of a formality, which
you will be able to arrange,&#8221; said the officer. &#8220;But I
am directed to place you under arrest. England is
in the war. You are said to be a former soldier.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XX' id='CHAPTER_XX'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p>Over the ragged lands that lay on the &#8220;nigh
side&#8221; of Hemlock Mountain breathed a spirit
of excitement and mighty hope. It had been
two years since John Spurrier had left the field he had
planned to develop, and in those years had come the
transition of rebirth.</p>
<p>Along muddy streets the hogs still wallowed, but
now they were deeply rutted by the teaming of ponderous
oil gear, and one saw young men in pith helmets
and pig-skin puttees; keen-faced engineers and oil
prospectors drawn in by the challenge of wealth from
the far trails of Mexico and the West. One heard the
jargon of that single business and the new vocabulary
of its devotees. &#8220;Wild-catters&#8221; following surface indications
or hunches were testing and well-driving.
Gushers rewarded some and &#8220;dry holes&#8221; and &#8220;dusters&#8221;
disappointed others. Into the mediæval life of hills
that had stood age-long unaltered and aloof came the
infusion of hot-blooded enterprise, the eager questing
after quick and miraculous wealth.</p>
<p>In Lexington and Winchester oil exchanges carried
the activity of small bourses. In newspapers a new
form of advertisement proclaimed itself.</p>
<p>Oil was king. Oil and its by-product, gasoline, that
the armies needed and that the thousands of engines
on the earth and in the air so greedily devoured.</p>
<p>But over on the far side of the ridge men only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
fretted and chafed as yet. They had the oil under
their feet, but for it there was no outlet. Like a land
without a seaport, they looked over at neighbors growing
rich while they themselves still &#8220;hurted fer needcessities.&#8221;</p>
<p>American Oil and Gas had locked them in while it
milked the other cow. It had its needed charters for
piping both fields, but a man who was either dead or
somewhere across the world held the way barred in
a stalemate of controlled rights of way.</p>
<p>Glory thought less about the wonderful things that
were going forward than did others about her, because
she had a broken heart. No letters came from
Spurrier, and the faith that she struggled to hold high
like a banner nailed to the masthead of her life, hung
drooping. In the end her colors had been struck.</p>
<p>If John Spurrier returned in search of her now
she would go into hiding from him, but it was most
unlikely that he would return. He had married her
on impulse and under a pressure of excitement. He
had loved her passionately&mdash;but not with a strong
enough fidelity to hold him true&mdash;and now she believed
he had turned back again to his old idols. She
was repudiated, and she ought to hate him with the
bitterness of her mountain blood, yet in her heart&#8217;s
core, though she would never forgive him and never
return to him, she knew that she still loved him and
would always love him.</p>
<p>She no longer feared that she would have hampered
him in the society of his more finished world.
She had visited Helen Merriwell and had come to
know that other world for herself. She found that
the gentle blood in her veins could claim its own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
rights and respond graciously. Hers had been a submerged
aristocracy, but it had come out of its
chrysalis, bright-winged.</p>
<p>Then one day something happened that turned
Glory&#8217;s little personal world upside down and brought
a readjustment of all its ideas.</p>
<p>Sim Colby owned a little patch of land beside his
homestead place, over cross the mountain, and he was
among those who became rich. He was not so rich
as local repute declared him, but rich enough to set
stirring the avarice of an erstwhile friend, who owned
no land at all.</p>
<p>So ex-Private Severance came over to the deserter&#8217;s
house with a scheme conceived in envy and born of
greed. He was bent on blackmail.</p>
<p>When he first arrived, the talk ran along general
lines, because &#8220;Blind Joe,&#8221; the fiddler, was at the
house, and the real object of the visit was confidential.
Blind Joe had also been an oil beneficiary, and he and
Sim Colby had become partners in a fashion. During
that relationship Blind Joe had told Sim some things
that he told few others.</p>
<p>But when Joe left and the pipes were lighted Severance
settled himself in a back-tilted chair and gazed
reflectively at the crest of the timber line.</p>
<p>&#8220;You an&#8217; me&#8217;s been partners for a right long spell,
Bud Grant, ain&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Colby started. The use of that discarded name
brought back the past with its ghosts of fear. He
had almost forgotten that once he had been Bud Grant,
and a deserter from the army. It was all part of a
bygone and walled-in long ago. Though they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
quite alone he looked furtively about him and spoke
in a lowered voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call me by thet name. Thar ain&#8217;t no man
but you knows erbout&mdash;what I used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been studyin&#8217; erbout. Nobody
else but me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Severance sat silent for a while after that announcement,
but there was a meaning smile on his lips, and
Colby paled a shade whiter.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> reckon I kin trust ye; I always hev,&#8221; he declared
with a specious confidence.</p>
<p>Severance nodded. &#8220;I was on guard duty an&#8217; I
suffered ye ter escape,&#8221; he went reminiscently on. &#8220;I
knows thet ye kilt Captain Comyn, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve done kept
a close mouth all these years. Now ye&#8217;re a rich man
an&#8217; I&#8217;m a pore one. Hit looks like ter me ye owes
me a debt an&#8217; ye&#8217;d ought ter do a leetle something
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>So that was it! Colby knew that if he yielded at
all, this man&#8217;s avarice and his importunities would
feed on themselves increasingly and endlessly. Yet
he dared not refuse, so he sought to temporize.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon thar&#8217;s right smart jestice in what ye says,&#8221;
he conceded, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know jest yit how I stands
or how much money I&#8217;m wuth. Ye&#8217;ll have ter give
me a leetle time ter find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when Severance mounted his mule and rode
away, Sim Colby gave him only a short start and
then hurried on foot through the hill tangles by a short
cut that would intercept his visitor&#8217;s course.</p>
<p>He knew that Severance would have to ride through
the same gorge in which Sim had waylaid Spurrier,
and he meant to get there first, rifle-armed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>It was sunset when, quite unsuspecting of danger, at
least for the moment, Severance turned his mule into
the gorge. He was felicitating himself, since without
an acre of land or a drop of oil he had &#8220;declared himself
in&#8221; on another&#8217;s wealth. His mule was a laggard
in pace, and the rider did not urge him. He was content
to amble.</p>
<p>Back of the rock walls of the great cleft, the woods
lay hushed and dense in the closing shadows. An owl
quavered softly, and the water among the ferns whispered.
All else was quiet.</p>
<p>But from just a little way back, a figure hitched forward
as it lay belly-down in the &#8220;laurel hell.&#8221; It
sighted a rifle and pressed a finger.</p>
<p>The mule snorted and stopped dead with a flirt of
ears and tail and with no word, without even a groan,
the rider toppled sidewise and slid from the saddle.</p>
<p>The man back in the brush peered out. He noted
how still the crumpled figure lay between the feet of
the patient, mouse-colored beast, that switched at
flies with its tail. It lay twisted almost double with
one arm bent beneath its chest.</p>
<p>So Colby crept closer. It would be as well to haul
the body back into the tangle where it would not be
so soon discovered, and to start the beast along its
way with a slap on the flank.</p>
<p>But just as the assassin stooped, Severance&#8217;s right
hand darted out and, as it did so, there was a quick
glint of blue steel, and three instantly successive
reports.</p>
<p>Colby staggered backward with a sense of betrayal
and a horrible realization of physical pain. His rifle
dropped from a shattered hand and jets of blood broke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
out through his rent clothing. Each of those three
pistol balls had taken effect at a range so close that he
had been powder-burned. He knew he was mortally
hurt, and that the other would soon be dead if he
was not so already.</p>
<p>Colby began crawling. He was mangled as if by
an explosion, but instinct drove him. Twice he fainted
and recovered dim consciousness and still dragged
himself tediously along.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Glory was alone in her house. Her father, who had
been living with her of late, had gone to the county
seat overnight.</p>
<p>The young woman sat in silence, and the sewing
upon which she had been busied lay in her lap forgotten.
In her eyes was the far-away look of one
who eats out one&#8217;s heart in thoughts that can neither
be solved nor banished.</p>
<p>Then she heard a faint call. It was hardly more
than a gasped whisper, and as she rose, startled, and
went to the door she saw striving to reach it a shape
of terrible human wreckage.</p>
<p>Sim Colby&#8217;s clothes were almost torn from him and
blood, dried brown, and blood freshly flowing,
mingled their ugly smears upon him. His lips were
livid and his face gray.</p>
<p>Glory ran to him with a horrified scream. She did
not yet recognize him, and he gasped out a plea for
whisky.</p>
<p>With the utmost effort of her young strength she
got him in, and managed to straighten out the mutilated
body with pillows under its head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>But after a little the stimulant brought a slight reviving,
and he talked in broken and disjointed phrases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit war Severance,&#8221; he mumbled. &#8220;I fought back&mdash;I
reckon I kilt him, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory gazed in bewildered alarm about the house.
Brother Bud Hawkins was at Uncle Jimmy Litchfield&#8217;s
place, and she must get medical help, though she
feared that the wounded man would be dead before
her return.</p>
<p>When she came back with the preacher, who also
&#8220;healed human bodies some,&#8221; Colby was still alive
but near his passing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ef thar&#8217;s aught on your conscience, Sim,&#8221; said
the old preacher gently, &#8220;hit&#8217;s time ter make yore peace
with Almighty God, fer ye&#8217;re goin&#8217; ter stand afore
him in an hour more. Air ye ready ter face Him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dying man looked up, and above the weakness
and the suffering that filled his eyes, showed a dominating
expression of terror. If ever a human being
needed to be shriven he thought it was himself.</p>
<p>They had to bend close to catch his feeble syllables,
as he said: &#8220;Git paper&mdash;write this down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The preacher obeyed, kneeling on the floor, and
though the words were few, their utterance required
dragging minutes, punctuated with breaks of silence
and gasping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit warn&#8217;t John Spurrier&mdash;thet kilt Captain
Comyn back tha&#8217;r in the Philippines.... I knows
who done hit&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He broke off there, and the girl
closed her hands over her face. &#8220;I sought ter kill
Spurrier&mdash;but I warn&#8217;t with them&mdash;thet attackted him
hyar&mdash;an&#8217; wounded ther woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more a long hiatus interrupted the recital and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
then the mangled creature went on: &#8220;Hit was ther
oil folks thet deevised thet murder scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p>The preacher was busily writing the record of this
death-bed statement and Glory stood pale and distraught.</p>
<p>The words &#8220;oil people&#8221; were ringing in her ears.
What connection could Spurrier have had with them:
what enmity could they have had for him?</p>
<p>But out of the confusion of her thoughts another
thing stood forth with the sudden glare of revelation.
This man might die before he finished and if he could
not tell all he knew, he must first tell that which would
clear her husband&#8217;s name. Though that husband had
turned his back on her, her duty to him in this matter
must take precedence over the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe Givins&mdash;&#8221; began Colby once more in laborious
syllables, but peremptorily the girl halted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind Joe Givins just now,&#8221; she commanded
with as sharp a finality as though to her had been
delegated the responsibility of his judgment. &#8220;You
said you knew who killed Captain Comyn. Who
was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes in the wounded and stricken face gazed up
at her in mute appeal as a sinner might look at a
father confessor, pleading that he be spared the bitterest
dregs of his admission.</p>
<p>Glory read that glance and her own delicate features
hardened. She leaned forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought you in here and succored you,&#8221; she
asserted with a sternness which she could not have
commanded in her own behalf. &#8220;You&#8217;re going before
Almighty God&mdash;and unless you answer that question
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
honestly&mdash;no prayers shall go with you for forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory!&#8221; The name broke in shocked horror from
the bearded lips of the preacher. &#8220;Glory, the mercy
of God hain&#8217;t ter be interfered with by mortals.
Ther man&#8217;s dying!&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon him the young woman wheeled with blazing
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;God calls on his servants for justice to the living
as well as mercy to the dying,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Sim
Colby, who killed Captain Comyn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I done hit,&#8221; came the unwillingly wrung confession.
&#8220;My real name&#8217;s Grant.... Severance aided
me.... Thet&#8217;s why I sought to kill Spurrier. I
deemed he war a huntin&#8217; me down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; ordered the young woman, &#8220;what about
Joe Givins?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again a long pause, then: &#8220;Blind Joe Givins&mdash;only
he ain&#8217;t no blinder than me&mdash;read papers hyar&mdash;he
diskivered thet Spurrier was atter oil rights&mdash;he
tipped off ther oil folks&mdash;he war their spy all ther
time&mdash;shammin&#8217; ter be blind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; There the speaker
struggled to breathe and let his head fall back with
the utterance incomplete. Five minutes later he was
dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit don&#8217;t seem ter me,&#8221; said Brother Hawkins a
short time later, while Glory still stood in dazed and
trance-like wonderment, &#8220;es ef what he said kin be
true. Why ef hit be, John Spurrier was aimin&#8217; ter
plunder us hyar all ther time! He was counselin&#8217; us
ter sell out&mdash;an&#8217; he was buyin&#8217;. I kain&#8217;t believe that.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Glory had drawn back to the wall of the room
and into her eyes had come a new expression. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
expression of one who must tear aside a veil and
know the truth, and who dreads what that truth
may be.</p>
<p>She had said that justice, no less than mercy, was
God&#8217;s command laid upon mortals. She had, almost
by the extremity of withholding from Colby his hope
of salvation until he spoke, won from him the declaration
which would give back to John Spurrier an unsmirched
name. Once Spurrier had said that was his
strongest wish in life. But now justice called again:
this time justice to her own people and perhaps it
meant the unveiling of duplicity in the man she had
married.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother Hawkins,&#8221; she declared in a low but fervent
voice, &#8220;if it&#8217;s not true, it&#8217;s a slander that I can&#8217;t
let stand. If it <i>is</i> true, I must undo the wrong he&#8217;s
sought to do&mdash;if I can. Please wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she was tearing at the bit of paneling that
gave access to the secret cabinet, and poring over
papers from a broken and rifled strong box.</p>
<p>There was the uncontrovertible record, clear writ,
and at length her pale face came up resolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it all yet,&#8221; she told the preacher.
&#8220;But he was buying. He bought everything that&#8217;s
been sold this side the ridge. He was seeking to influence
the legislature, too. I&#8217;ve got to talk to my
father.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was the next night, when old Dyke Cappeze had
ridden back from the county seat, that he sat under
the lamp in the room where Sim Colby had died, and
on the table before him were spread the papers that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
had lain unread so long in John Spurrier&#8217;s secret
cabinet.</p>
<p>Across from him sat Glory with her fingers spasmodically
clutched and her eyes riveted on his face as
he read and studied the documents, which at first he
had been loath to inspect without the permission of
their owner. He had been convinced, however, when
Glory had told the story of the dying confession and
had appealed to him for counsel.</p>
<p>&#8220;By what you tell me,&#8221; the old lawyer had summarized
at the end of her recital, &#8220;you forced from
this man his admission which cleared John Spurrier
of the charge that&#8217;s been hanging over him. You set
out to serve him and refused to be turned aside when
Colby balked.... But that confession didn&#8217;t end
there. It went on and besides clearing Jack in that
respect it seems to have involved him in another way.
You can&#8217;t use a part of a confession and discard the
balance. Perhaps we can serve him as well as others
best by going into the whole of the affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>So now Glory interrupted by no word or question,
despite her anxiety to understand and her hoping
against hope for a verdict which should leave John
Spurrier clean of record.</p>
<p>But if she refrained from breaking in on the study
that engrossed her father and wrinkled his parchment-like
forehead, she could not help reading the expression
of his eyes, the growing sternness and indignation
of his stiffening lips&mdash;and of drawing the moral
that when he spoke his words must be those of condemnation.</p>
<p>The strident song of the katydids came in through
the windows and the moon dropped behind the hill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
crests before Dyke Cappeze spoke, and Brother Hawkins,
who was spending the night at that house,
smoked alone on the porch, unwilling to intrude on
the confidences that these two might wish to exchange.</p>
<p>Finally the lawyer folded the last paper and
looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want the whole truth, little gal?&#8221; he inquired
bluntly. &#8220;How much do you still love this
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory flushed then paled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; she said and her words were very low
and soft, &#8220;I&#8217;ll love him so long as I live&mdash;though I
hate myself for doing it. He wearied of me and
forgot me&mdash;but I can&#8217;t do likewise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then her chin came up and her voice rang with a
quiet finality.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want the truth ... the whole truth without
any softening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then as I see it, it&#8217;s simply this. A war was on
between two groups of financiers. American Oil and
Gas had held a monopoly and maintained a corrupt
control in the legislature that stifled competition.
That&#8217;s why the other oil boom failed. The second
group was trying to slip up on these corruptionists
and gain the control by a campaign of surprise. Jack
Spurrier appears to have been the ambassador of that
second group&mdash;and he seems to have failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wife nodded. Even yet she unconsciously held
a brief for his defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as you&#8217;ve gone,&#8221; she reminded her father,
&#8220;you show him to have been what is commonly called
a &#8216;practical business man&#8217;&mdash;but no worse than the
men he fought.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>Cappeze bowed his head gravely and his next words
came reluctantly. &#8220;So far, yes. Of course he could
have done none of the things he did had he not first
won the confidence of those poor ignorant folk that
are our neighbors and our friends. Of course it was
because they believed in him and followed his counsel
that they sold their birthrights to men with whom he
pretended to have no connection&mdash;and yet who took
their orders from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Glory started, halted and leaned forward
with her hands against her breast and her utterance
was the monotone of a voice forced to a hard question:
&#8220;Then what I feared was true? He lived
among us and made friends of us&mdash;only to rob us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If by &#8216;us&#8217; you mean the mountain people, I fear
me that&#8217;s precisely what he did. I can see no other
explanation. Which ever of these two groups won
meant to exploit and plunder us.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a little she made no answer, but the delicate
color of her cheeks was gone to an ivory whiteness
and the violet eyes were hardening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we oughtn&#8217;t to judge him too harshly
for these things,&#8221; said the father comfortingly. &#8220;The
scroll of my bitterness against him is already heavy
enough and to spare. He has broken your heart and
that&#8217;s enough for me. As to the rest there are many
so-called honorable gentlemen who are no more scrupulous.
We demand clean conduct here in these
hills,&#8221; a fierce bitterness came into his words, &#8220;but
then we are ignorant, backwoods folk! There are
many intricate ins and outs to this business and I don&#8217;t
presume to speak with absolute conclusiveness yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside the katydids sang their prophecies of frost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
to come and an owl hooted. Glory Spurrier sat staring
ahead of her and at last she said aloud, in that
tone which one uses when a thought finds expression,
unconscious that it has been vocal: &#8220;So he won our
faith&mdash;with his clear eyes and his honest smile&mdash;only
to swindle and rob us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, if I were a younger man,&#8221; broke out the
father passionately, rising from his chair and clenching
the damaging papers in his talon-like fingers, &#8220;I&#8217;d
learn the oil game. I&#8217;d take this information and use
it against both their gangs&mdash;and I believe I could
force them both to their knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and the momentary fire died out of his
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too old a dog for new tricks though,&#8221; he added
dejectedly, &#8220;and there&#8217;s no one else to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could it be done?&#8221; demanded Glory rousing
herself from her trance. &#8220;Between them they
hold all the power, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as I can make out,&#8221; Cappeze explained
with the interest of the legalistic mind for tackling
an abstruse problem, &#8220;Spurrier had completed his
arch as to one of his two purposes&mdash;all except its
keystone. He had yet to gain a passage way through
Brother Hawkins&#8217; land. With that he would have
held the completed right-of-way&mdash;and it&#8217;s the only
one. The other gang of pirates hold the ability to get
a charter but no right of way over which to use it.
Now the man who could deliver Brother Hawkins&#8217;
concession would have a key. He could force Spurrier&#8217;s
crowd to agree to almost anything, and with
Spurrier&#8217;s crowd he could wring a compromise from
the others. Bud Hawkins is like the delegate at a convention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
who can break a deadlock. God knows I&#8217;d
love to tackle it&mdash;but it&#8217;s too late for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory had come to her feet, and stood an incarnation
of combat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not too late for me,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;Perhaps
I&#8217;m too crude to go into John Spurrier&#8217;s world
of cultivated people but I&#8217;m shrewd enough to go
into his world of business!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; exclaimed the father in astonishment, then
after a moment an eager light slowly dawned in his
eyes and he broke out vehemently: &#8220;By God in
Heaven, girl, I believe you&#8217;re the man for the job!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call Brother Hawkins in,&#8221; commanded Glory.
&#8220;We need his help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he reached the door old Cappeze turned on
his heel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ve need to move out of this
house and go back to my place. Here we&#8217;re dwelling
under a dishonest roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave it,&#8221; she responded quickly, &#8220;but
I&#8217;m going farther away than that. I&#8217;m going to study
oil and I&#8217;m going to do it in the Bluegrass lowlands.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXI' id='CHAPTER_XXI'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p>John Spurrier stepped from the train at Carnettsville
into a life that had been revolutionized.
At last he had succeeded in leaving his German
exile. His own country was in the war but he, with the
equipment of a soldier, bore a dishonored name, which
would bar him from a commission. Here he found
the development of his dreams realized, but by other
hands than his own.</p>
<p>Above all, he must see Glory. He had cabled her
and written her, so she would be expecting him. Now
he gazed about streets through which teemed the new
activity.</p>
<p>Here was the thing he had seen in his dreams when
he stood on wooded hills and thought in the terms
of the future. Here it stood vivid and actual before
the eyes that had visioned it.</p>
<p>With a groan he turned into the road homeward on
a hired horse. He still meant to fight, and unless the
Bud Hawkins property had escaped him, he would
still have to be accounted with&mdash;but great prizes had
slipped away.</p>
<p>At the gate of his house, his heart rose into his
throat. The power of his emotion almost stifled him.
Never had his love for Glory flickered. Never had he
thought or dreamed of anything else or any one else
so dearly and so constantly as of her.</p>
<p>He stood at the fence with half-closed eyes for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
moment, steadying himself against the surges of up-welling
emotion, then, raising his eyes, he saw that
the windows and the door were nailed up. The chimney
stood dead and smokeless.</p>
<p>Panic clutched at his throat as with a physical grasp.
Before him trooped a hundred associations unaccountably
dear. They were all memories of little
things, mostly foolish little things that went into the
sacred intimacy of his life with Glory.</p>
<p>Now there was no Glory there.</p>
<p>He rode at the best speed left in his tired horse over
to old Cappeze&#8217;s house, and, as he dismounted, saw
the lawyer, greatly aged and broken, standing in the
door.</p>
<p>One glance at that face confirmed all the fears with
which he had been battling. It was a face as stern as
those on the frieze of the prophets. In it there was
no ghost of the old welcome, no hope of any relenting.
This old man saw in him an enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Glory?&#8221; demanded Spurrier as he hurried
up to the doorstep, and the other looked accusingly
back into his eyes and answered in cold and bitterly
clipped syllables.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever she is, sir, it&#8217;s her wish to be there
alone.&#8221; Suddenly the old eyes flamed and the old
voice rose thin and passionate. &#8220;If I burned in hell
for it to the end of eternity, I would give you no
other word of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;she is not dead, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but dead to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cappeze,&#8221; said Spurrier steadily, &#8220;are you
sure that I may not have explanations that may change
her view of me?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We know,&#8221; said the lawyer in a voice out of which
the passion had passed, but which had the dead quality
of an opinion inflexibly solidified, &#8220;that since
your marriage, you never made her the companion of
any hour that was not a backwoods hour. We know
that you never told us the truth about yourself or your
enterprises&mdash;that you came to us as a friend, won our
confidence, and sought to exploit us. Your record is
one of lies and unfaithfulness, and we have cast you
out. That is her decision and with me her wish is
sacred.&#8221;</p>
<p>The returned exile stood meeting the relentless eyes
of the old man who had been his first friend in these
hills and for a few moments he did not trust himself
to speak.</p>
<p>The shock of those shuttered windows and that
blankly staring front at the house where he had looked
for welcome; the collapse of all the dreams that
had sustained him while a prisoner in an internment
camp and a refugee hounded across the German border
were visiting upon him a prostration that left him
trembling and shaken.</p>
<p>Finally he commanded his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, too, her wish is sacred&mdash;but not until I hear
it from her own lips. She alone has the right to
condemn me and not even she until I have made my
plea to her. Great God, man, my silence hasn&#8217;t been
voluntary. I&#8217;ve been cut off in a Hun prison-camp.
I&#8217;ve kept life in me only because I could dream of her
and because though it was easier to die, I couldn&#8217;t die
without seeing her and explaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was from her own lips that I took my orders,&#8221;
came the unmoved response. &#8220;Those orders were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
that through me you should learn nothing. You had
the friendship of every man here until you abused it&mdash;now
I think you&#8217;ll encounter no sympathy. I told
you once how the wolf-bitch would feel toward the
man who robbed her of her young. You chose to disregard
my warning&mdash;and I&#8217;ll ask you to leave my
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Spurrier bowed his head. He had lost her!
If that were her final conclusion, he could hardly seek
to dissuade her. At least he could lose the final happiness
out of his life&mdash;from which so much else had already
been lost&mdash;as a gentleman should lose.</p>
<p>And he knew that however old Cappeze might feel,
he would not lie. If he said that was Glory&#8217;s deliberately
formed decision, that statement must be accepted
as true.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never loved any one else,&#8221; said Spurrier
slowly. &#8220;I shall never love any one else. I have been
faithful despite appearances. The rest of your charges
are true, and I make no denial. I gambled about as
fairly as most men gamble. That is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>A stiffening pride, made flinty by the old man&#8217;s hostility,
shut into silence some things that Spurrier
might have said. He scorned the seeming of whine
that might have lain in explanations, even though the
explanations should lighten the shadow of his old
friend&#8217;s disapproval. He offered no extenuation and
breathed nothing of the changes that had been
wrought in himself by the tedious alchemy of time and
reflection.</p>
<p>He had begun under the spur of greedy ambition,
but changes had been wrought in him by Glory&#8217;s love.</p>
<p>He was still ambitious, but in a different way. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
wanted to salvage something for the equitable beneficiaries.
He wanted to stand, not among the predatory
millionaires, but to be his own man, with a clean
name and solvent.</p>
<p>Before he could attain that condition he must render
unto Harrison the things that were Harrison&#8217;s
and wipe out his own tremendous liabilities&mdash;but his
heart was in the hills.</p>
<p>John Spurrier went slowly and heavy heartedly
back to the house which he had refashioned for his
bride; the house that had become to him a shrine to
all the dear, lost things of life.</p>
<p>The sun fell in mottled luminousness across its
face of tempered gray and from the orchard where
the lush grass grew knee-high came the cheery whistle
of a Bob-white.</p>
<p>At the sound the man groaned with a wrench of his
heart and throat, and his thoughts raced back to that
day when the same note had come from the voices of
hidden assassins and when Glory had exposed her
breast to rifle-fire to send out the pigeon with its call
for help.</p>
<p>The splendid oak that had shaded their stile had
grown broader of girth and more majestic in the
spread of its head-growth since he had stood
here before, and in the flower beds, in which Glory
had delighted, a few forlorn survivors, sprung up as
volunteers from neglected roots, struggled through a
choke of dusty weeds.</p>
<p>The man looked about the empty yard and his
breath came like that of a torture victim on the rack.
The desolation and ache of a life deprived of all that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
made it sweet struck in upon him with a blight beside
which his prison loneliness had been nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she knew the whole truth&mdash;instead of only half
the truth,&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;she might forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ripped the padlock from the door and let himself
in. He flung wide a shutter and let the afternoon
sun flood the room, and once inside a score of little
things worked the magic of memory upon him and
tore afresh every wound that was festering.</p>
<p>There hung the landscapes that he and she had
loved and as he looked at them her voice seemed to
sound again in his ears like forgotten music. From
somewhere came the heavy fragrance of honeysuckle
and old nights with her in the moonlight rushed back
upon him.</p>
<p>Then he saw an apron on a peg&mdash;hanging limp and
empty, and again he saw her in it. He went and
opened a drawer in which his own clothes had been
kept&mdash;and there neatly folded by her hand were things
of his.</p>
<p>John Spurrier, whose iron nerve had once been café
talk in the Orient, sat down on a quilted bed and tearless
sobs racked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said to himself at last. &#8220;No, if she wants
her freedom I can&#8217;t pursue her. I&#8217;ve hurt her enough&mdash;and
God knows I&#8217;m punished enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless he were tamely to surrender to the despair
that beset him, John Spurrier had one other thing to
do before he left the hills. He must come to such an
agreement with Bud Hawkins as would give him a
right of way over that single tract and complete his
chain of holdings. Thus fortified the field beyond
the ridge would be safe against invasion by his enemies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
and even the other field would have readier outlet
to market by that route. In the Hawkins property
lay the keystone of the arch. With it the position was
impregnable. Without it all the rest fell apart like an
inarticulated skeleton.</p>
<p>It happened that Spurrier met Hawkins as he went
away from his lonely house, and forcing his own miseries
into the background, he sought to become the
business man once more. He began with a frank
statement of the facts and offered fair and substantial
terms of trade.</p>
<p>Both because his affection for the old preacher
would have tolerated nothing less and because it would
have been folly now to play the cheaper game, he
spoke in the terms of generosity.</p>
<p>But to his surprise and discomfiture, Brother Hawkins
shook a stubborn head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t skeercely no power on &#8217;arth, Mr. Spurrier,&#8221;
he declared, &#8220;thet could fo&#8217;ce me inter doin&#8217; no
business with ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Brother Hawkins,&#8221; argued the opportunity
hound, &#8220;you are cutting your own throat. You and I
standing together are invincible. Separate, we are
lost. I&#8217;m almost willing to let you name the terms of
agreement&mdash;to write the contract for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done been pore a right long while already,&#8221;
the preacher reminded him as his eyes kindled with
the zealot&#8217;s fire. &#8220;Long afore my day Jesus Christ
was pore an&#8217; ther Apostle Paul, an&#8217; other righteous
men. I ain&#8217;t skeered ter go on in likewise ter what
I&#8217;ve always done.&#8221; He paused and laid a kindly hand
on the shoulder of the man who offered him wealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t seekin&#8217; ter fault ye unduly, John Spurrier.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
Mebby ye&#8217;ve done follered yore lights&mdash;but we don&#8217;t
see with no common eye, ner no mutual disc&#8217;arnment.
Ye&#8217;ve done misled folk thet swore by ye, ef I sees hit
a&#8217;right. Now ye offers me wealth, much ther same as
Satan offered hit ter Jesus on a high place, an&#8217; we
kain&#8217;t trade&mdash;no more then what they could trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old preacher&#8217;s attitude held the trace of kindliness
that sought to drape reproof in gentleness and to
him, as had been impossible with Cappeze, Spurrier
poured out his confidence. At the outset, he confessed,
he had deliberately dedicated himself to the
development of wealth for himself and his employers,
with no thought of others. Later, in a fight between
wary capitalists where vigilance had to be met with
vigilance, the seal of secrecy had been imperative.
Frankness with the mountain men would have been a
warning to his enemies. Now, however, his sense of
responsibility was awake. Now he wanted to win
back his status of confidence in this land where he
had known his only home. Now what weight he had
left to throw into the scales would be righteously
thrown. Even yet he must move with strict, guarded
secrecy.</p>
<p>But the old circuit rider shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit&#8217;s too late, now, ter rouse faith in me, John,&#8221;
he reiterated. &#8220;Albeit I&#8217;d love ter credit ye, ef so-be
I could. What&#8217;s come ter pass kain&#8217;t be washed out
with words.&#8221; He paused before he added the simple
edict against which there was no arguing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebby I mout stand convinced even yit ef I didn&#8217;t
know thet ther devil was urgin&#8217; me on with prospects
of riches.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing remained to him; the pride that should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
stiffen him in the presence of his accusers and judges.
When he went into the eclipse of ruin, at least he
would go with unflinching gallantry.</p>
<p>And it was in that mood that Spurrier reached his
club in New York and prepared himself for the ordeal
of the next day&#8217;s interview.</p>
<p>He had wired Harrison of his coming, but not of
his hopelessness, and when his telephone jangled and
he heard the voice of the financier, he recognized in it
an undercurrent of exasperation, which carried omen
of a difficult interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Spurrier? This is Harrison. Be at my
office at eleven to-morrow morning. Perhaps you can
construe certain riddles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of what nature, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of a nature that won&#8217;t bear full discussion over
the wire. We have had an anonymous letter from
some mysterious person who claims to come with the
situation in a sling. It may be a crank whom we&#8217;ll
have to throw out&mdash;or some one we dare not ignore.
At all events, it&#8217;s up to you to dispose of him. He&#8217;s in
your province. If you fail, we lose out and, as I
said once before, you go to the scrap heap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier hung up the phone and sat in a nerveless
trepidation which was new and foreign to his nature.
This interview of to-morrow morning would call for
the tallest bluffing he had ever attempted, and the
chances would, perhaps, turn on hair-trigger elements
of personal force.</p>
<p>He must depend on his coolness, audacity, and
adroitness to win a decision, and, except by guesswork,
he could not hope to formulate in advance the terrain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
of battle or the nature of counter-attack with which
he must meet his adversary.</p>
<p>That evening he strolled along Broadway and found
himself yielding to a dangerous and whimsical mood.
He wondered how many other men outwardly as self-assured
and prosperous as himself were covertly confessing
suicide as one of to-morrow&#8217;s probabilities.</p>
<p>Over Longacre Square the incandescent billboards
flamed and flared. The darning-wool kitten disported
itself with mechanical abandon. The woman who
advertised a well-known corset and the man who exploited
a brand of underwear brilliantly made and
unmade their toilets far above the sidewalk level.
Motors shrieked and droned and crowds drifted.</p>
<p>Before a moving-picture theater, his introspective
eye was momentarily challenged by a gaudy three-sheet.
The poster proclaimed a popular screen star
in a &#8220;fight fuller of punch than that of &#8216;The Wreckers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>What caused Spurrier to pause was the composition
of the picture&mdash;and the mental comparison which
it evoked. A man crouched behind a heavy table,
overthrown for a barricade&mdash;as he had once done.</p>
<p>Fallen enemies lay on the floor of a crude Western
cabin. Others still stood, and fought with flashing
guns and faces &#8220;registering&#8221; desperation, frenzy, and
maniac fury. The hero only, though alone and outnumbered,
was grimly calm. The stress of that inferno
had not interfered with the theatric pose of head
and shoulders&mdash;the grace and effect of gesture that
was conveyed in the two hands wielding two smoking
pistols.</p>
<p>Spurrier smiled. It occurred to him that had a director
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
stood by while he himself had knelt behind a
table he would have bawled out many amendments
which fact had overlooked. Apparently he and his
attackers had, by these exacting standards of art,
missed the drama of the situation.</p>
<p>Over him swept a fresh flood of memory, and it
brought a cold and nervous dampness to his temples.
Again he saw Glory rising at the broken window with
a pigeon to release&mdash;and a life to sacrifice, if need be.
On her face had been no theatric expression which
would have warranted a close-up.</p>
<p>Spurrier hastened on, turning into a side street
where he could put the glare at his back and find a
more mercifully dark way.</p>
<p>He was seeing, instead of dark house fronts, the
tops of pine trees etched against an afterglow, and
Glory standing silhouetted against a hilltop. Above
the grind of the elevated and the traffic, he was hearing
her voice in thrushlike song, happy because he
loved her.</p>
<p>The agony of loss overwhelmed him, and he actually
longed, as for a better thing, for that moment to
come back when behind an overturned table he had
endured the suspense which death had promised to end
in an instant filled and paid for with revenge.</p>
<p>Then through his disturbed brain once more flashed
lines of verse:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;I was ever a fighter, so&mdash;one fight more,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The best and the last!</p>
<p>I should hate that Death bandaged my eyes and forebore,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And bade me creep past.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>At all events he would, in the figurative sense, die
fighting to-morrow. He knew his mistakes now. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
he lived on he hoped to atone for them, but if he died
he would go out without a whine.</p>
<p>And if he must die, there was one way that seemed
preferable to others. The army would have none of
him, as an officer, because he stood besmirched of
honor. But he knew the stern temper of the mountaineers.
They would rise in unanimous response to
the call of arms. He could go with them, not with
any insignia on his collar, but marching shoulder
against shoulder into that red hell of Flanders and
France, where a man might baptize himself, shrive
himself, and die. And in dying they would leave a
record behind them!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p>Down along the creekbeds back of Hemlock
Mountain young Jimmy Litchfield, a son of
old Uncle Jimmy, had been teaming with a
well-boring outfit and his wagon had bogged down
in deep mud. He had failed to extricate himself so
he tramped three hard, steep miles and telephoned for
an extra team. While he awaited deliverance he
found himself irked and, to while away the time, set
his drill down haphazard and began to bore.</p>
<p>It would be some hours before help arrived, and
when he had worked a while he had forgotten all
about help.</p>
<p>His drill had struck through soft gravel to an oil
pool lying close to the surface, and the black tide
gushed crazily.</p>
<p>Young Jimmy sat back watching the dark jet that
he had no means of stemming or containing, and
through his simple soul flowed all the intoxication of
triumph.</p>
<p>He was the discoverer of a new&mdash;and palpably a
rich field!</p>
<p>Hereafter oil men would speak of the Snake Creek
field as copper men spoke of Anaconda or gold men
of the Yukon.</p>
<p>And that night word went by wire to the opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
hound who had just gone east, that the &#8220;fur&#8221;
side was to the &#8220;nigh&#8221; side as gold is to silver.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221; demanded Harrison,
when Spurrier, secure in his seeming of undaunted
assurance, arrived at his office and the response came
smilingly: &#8220;I think it means a bluff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read that,&#8221; snapped the financier as he flung a letter
across his desk.</p>
<p>Spurrier took the sheet of paper and read in a hand,
evidently disguised!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You find yourself in a cul-de-sac. I hold the key to a
way out. My terms are definite and determined in advance.
I shall be at your office at noon, Tuesday. We will do business
at that time, or not at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; said Spurrier, &#8220;that this seems to me a
brass-bound bluff. I make only the request that I be
permitted to talk with this brigand alone; to sound
him out with no interference and to shape my policy
by the circumstances. I&#8217;m not at all frightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrison answered snappily:</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree to that&mdash;but if you fail you fail finally.&#8221;</p>
<p>So on Tuesday forenoon Spurrier sat cross-legged
in Harrison&#8217;s office and their discussion had come to
its end. Now, he had only to await the unknown
person who was to arrive at noon bearing alleged
terms, a person who claimed to be armed for battle
if battle were needed.</p>
<p>At Harrison&#8217;s left and right sat his favored lieutenants,
but Spurrier himself occupied a chair a little
bit apart, relegated to a zone of probation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>Then a rap sounded on the door, and Spurrier
smiled with a ghost of triumph as he noted that he
alone of the small group did not start at the signal.
For all their great caliber and standing, these men
were keyed to expectancy and exasperated nervousness.</p>
<p>The clerk who appeared made his announcement
with the calculated evenness of routine: &#8220;A lady is
waiting. She says her name doesn&#8217;t matter. She has
an appointment for twelve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lady!&#8221; exclaimed Harrison in amazement. &#8220;My
God, do we have to fight this thing out with a
woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>The tableau of astonishment held, until Spurrier
broke it:</p>
<p>&#8220;What matter <a name='TC_12'></a><ins title='Was personalties'>personalities</ins> to us?&#8221; he blandly inquired.
&#8220;We are interested in facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief lifted his hand and gave curt direction.
&#8220;Show her in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then through the door came a woman whose beauty
would have arrested attention in any gathering. Just
now what these men, rising grudgingly from their
chairs, noted first, was the self-possession, the poise,
and the convincing evidence of good breeding and
competency which characterized her.</p>
<p>She was elegantly but plainly dressed, and her manner
conveyed a self-assurance in nowise flustered by
the prospect of impending storm.</p>
<p>No one there, save Spurrier, recognized her, for to
Martin Harrison carrying the one disapproving impression
of a mountain girl in patched gingham, the
transformation was complete.</p>
<p>And as for Spurrier himself, after coming to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
feet, he stood as a man might be expected to stand if
a specter of death had suddenly materialized before
him.</p>
<p>For the one time in his life all the assumption of
boldness, worn for other eyes, broke and fell away
from him, leaving him nakedly and starkly dumbfounded.
He presented the pale and distressed aspect
of a whipped prize fighter, reeling groggily
against the ropes, and defenseless against attack.</p>
<p>It was a swift transformation from audacious
boldness to something which seemed abject, or that
at least was the aspect which presented itself to Martin
Harrison and his aides, but back of it all lay reasons
into which they could not see.</p>
<p>It was no crumbling and softening of battle metal
that had wrought this astonishing metamorphosis but
a thing much nearer to the man&#8217;s heart. At that moment
there departed from his mind the whole urgent
call of the duel between business enemies&mdash;and he
saw only the woman for whom he had sought and
whom he had not found.</p>
<p>In the cumulative force and impact of their heart-breaking
sequence there rushed back on him all the
memories that had been haunting him, intensified to
unspeakable degree at the sight of her face&mdash;and if
he thought of the business awaiting them at all, it was
only with a stabbing pain of realization that he had
met Glory again only in the guise of an enemy.</p>
<p>Harrison gave him one contemptuous glance and
remarked brutally:</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam, this gentleman was to talk with you, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
he seems scarcely able to conduct any affair of moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory was looking at the broken man, too, and into
her splendid eyes stole a pity that had tenderness back
of it.</p>
<p>Old memories came in potent waves, and she closed
her lids for a moment as though against a painful
glare, but with quick recovery she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is imperative, gentlemen, that I have a few
words first&mdash;and alone&mdash;with Mr. Spurrier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you insist, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Harrison&#8217;s shoulders stiffened.
&#8220;But we do not guarantee that we shall abide
by his declarations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do insist&mdash;and I think you will find that it is I
who am in the position to dictate terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrison gave a sharply imperative gesture toward
the door through which the others filed out, followed
by the chief himself, leaving the two alone.</p>
<p>Then John Spurrier rose, and supported himself by
hands pressed upon the table top. He stood unsteadily
at first and failed in his effort to speak. Then,
with difficulty, he straightened and swept his two
hands out in a gesture of surrender.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought there was still
one fight left in me&mdash;but I can&#8217;t fight you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer and, after a little, with a slight
regaining of his self-command, he went on again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory! What a name and what a fulfillment!
You have always been Glory to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of his eyes slowly went the apathy of despair
and another look of even stronger feeling preëmpted
its place: a look of worship and adoration.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; admitted Glory softly, &#8220;that I was
to meet you here. I didn&#8217;t know that the fight was
to be between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have ruined me,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m a sinking
ship now, and those rats out there will leave me&mdash;but
it&#8217;s worth ruin to see you again. I want you to
take this message with you and remember it. All my
life I&#8217;ve gambled hard and fought hard. Now I
fail hard. I lost you and deserved to lose you, but
I&#8217;ve always loved you and always shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes grew stern, repressing the tenderness and
pity that sought to hold them soft.</p>
<p>&#8220;You abandoned me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You sought to
plunder my people. I took up their fight, and I shall
win it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spurrier came a step toward her and spread his
hands in a gesture of surrender, but he had recovered
from the shock that had so unnerved him a few minutes
ago and there was now a certain dignity in his
acceptance of defeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I break my sword across my knee,&#8221; he declared,
&#8220;and since I must do it, I&#8217;m glad you are the victor.
I won&#8217;t ask for mercy even from you&mdash;but when you
say I abandoned you, you are grievously wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you say I sought to plunder your people, you
speak the truth about me&mdash;as I was before I came to
love you. From that time on I sought to serve your
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sought to serve them?&#8221; she repeated in perplexity,
&#8220;The record shows nothing of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And since the record doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered steadily,
&#8220;any assertions and protestations would be without

proof. I&#8217;ve told you, because my heart compelled
me. I won&#8217;t try to convince you. At all events, since
I failed, my motives don&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your motives are everything. I took up the fight,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;because I thought a Spurrier had wronged
them. I wanted a Spurrier to make restitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I saw only the game, dear heart,&#8221; he confessed,
&#8220;never the unfairness. I&#8217;m ready to pay the
price. Ruin me&mdash;but in God&#8217;s name, believe that I
love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hand came out waveringly at that, and for a
moment rested on his shoulder with a little gesture of
tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I hated you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I tried to hate
you. I&#8217;ve dedicated myself to my people and their
rights&mdash;but if you trust me enough, call them in and
let me talk with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust you enough!&#8221; he exclaimed passionately,
then he caught her to him, and, when he let her go, he
stood again transformed and revivified into the man
he had seemed before she appeared in the doorway.
It was as though the touch of her lips had given him
the fire from which he rose ph&oelig;nixlike.</p>
<p>With an unhesitant step he went to the door and
opened it, and the men who had gone out trooped
back and ranged themselves again about the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Spurrier did all in your interests that a man
could do,&#8221; said Glory. &#8220;He failed to secure your
charter and he failed to secure the one tract that serves
as the key. I am a mountain woman seeking only to
protect my people. I hold that tract as trustee for Bud
Hawkins. I mean to do business, but only at a fair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
price. It&#8217;s for you to determine whether I deal with
you or your competitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>A look of consternation spread over the faces of
the lesser men, but Harrison inquired with a grim
smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam, haven&#8217;t I seen you somewhere before to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once before&mdash;down in the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are this man&#8217;s wife! Was this dramatic
incident prearranged between you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised an imperative hand, and her voice admitted
no question of sincerity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no such mistake. Mr. Spurrier knew nothing
of this. He was loyal enough&mdash;to you. From
him I never even learned the nature of his business.
Without his knowledge <i>I</i> was loyal to my people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then for ten minutes she talked clearly, forcefully,
and with the ring of indubitable sincerity giving fire
to voice and manner. She told of the fight she and
her father had made to keep heart in mountain folk,
enraged by what they believed to be the betrayal by a
man they had trusted and attacked by every means
of coercion at the disposal of American Oil and Gas.</p>
<p>She told of small local reservoirs, mysteriously
burned by unknown incendiaries; of neighborhood
pipe lines cut until they spilled out their wealth again
into the earth; of how she herself had walked these
lines at night, watching against sabotage.</p>
<p>As she talked with simple directness and without
self-vaunting, they saw her growing in the trust of
these men whose wrath had been, in the words of old
Cappeze, &#8220;Like that of the wolf-bitch robbed a second
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
time of her whelps.&#8221; They recognized the faith that
had commissioned her to speak as trustee, and to act
with carte-blanche powers.</p>
<p>Harrison and his subordinates were not susceptible
men, easily swayed by a dramatic circumstance, so
they cross-examined and heckled her with shrewd and
tripping inquiries, until she reminded them that she
had not come as a supplicant, but to lay before them
terms, which they would, at their peril, decline to accept.</p>
<p>The realization was strong in them that she had
spoken only the truth when she declared that she held
the key. When they were convinced that she realized,
in full, the strength of her position, they had no wish
to antagonize longer.</p>
<p>The group of financiers drew apart, but after a brief
consultation Harrison came forward and offered his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Spurrier,&#8221; he announced crisply, &#8220;we have
gone too far to draw back. After all, I think you
come rather as a rescue party than an attacker. Spurrier,
you have married a damned brilliant woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glory accepted the extended hand of peace, and
Harrison, with a jerk of his head to the door, led
his followers out, leaving them alone again.</p>
<p>Then Glory held out her arms, and into the bright
depths of her eyes flashed the old bewitching merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s a lavish of things I needs ter know, Jack,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to l&#8217;arn &#8217;em all ter me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I come now, not as teacher but as pupil, dear
heart,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;and I come humbly.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>Then her face grew serious and her voice vibrant
with tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have another gift for you, Jack, besides myself,
I can give you back an untarnished name.&#8221;</p>
